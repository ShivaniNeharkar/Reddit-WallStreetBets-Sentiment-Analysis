Why you should hold. Opportunity still exists. *Long read 10 Min* Realistic outlook.,618,lbkzob,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbkzob/why_you_should_hold_opportunity_still_exists_long/,118,1612378015,"*Im holding shares of GME at a average price of $56, my view may be biased but I tried to look at all evidence and not be.*

I know a lot of you are looking for confirmation that you should still hold, the truth is that may or may not be in your best interest. Only you can decide will all the information you have what’s best. Don’t listen to random people online.

However I’m going to let you know why I’m still holding. I bought in with a average price of $56 and a lot of the shares bought below $100 will be held by people who haven’t sold yet and aren’t planning on. Institutions and smart investors with a good amount of shares (*200+*) are currently holding, mostly paper hands (people who jumped on because of media/word of mouth) are gone now and they most likely didn’t have a big amount of shares anyway. We also temporarily lost swing traders because of the restrictions and loss of momentum, people with big balances who seen big dips as swinging opportunities (*$124 to $300 for example*) yes they sell but when they buy it brings pressure back and the price up which brings confidence for other people to invest in. I still think SI is high and HF aren’t out the game yet. With how high the SI is and the low float I think we would have seen a lot more volume on Wednesday/Thursday/Friday. The whole world was buying so this kind of volume to me even if it was HF unloading dosent signal them unwinding. 

*So what’s the game plan?*

Well firstly I think the HF couldn’t have let the whole world buy shares and have a short squeeze, they would be in to much debt and the price may very well have gone past $2000 due to a massive amount of people buying (*people normally not involved in stocks*) and the HF would of become insolvent. What I think the HF did is allow retail to buy during the week with Melvin unwinding their position, then once retail buying pressure starts to decrease due to people already in the stock, start to coordinate together with other HFs to restrict buying on some brokers (*decrease buying pressure*) and slow down the momentum caused by the internet and people talking about the squeeze. They would then let people sell and induce FUD which changed the narrative and worked, the price is now at a more comfortable level for them $90. On the 09/02/21 we will see latest SI (*2 weeks ago date*) and I’m assuming it will still be over 100%. They will try to bring price as low as they can but there will be a people with large amount of shares bought early they won’t fold (*some can’t sell*). When good earnings come out and in addition to Cohen turning the company around and increasing the valuation until fair price is $100. 

Then we may see the HFs unwind and the short squeeze would happen, at a much lower price for them as to not have to buy back shares at $500+ also with less people involved (*retail got bored/lost too much money and isn’t financially involved with GME*) there will be less competition to buy shares. They don’t want the whole world’s eyes on them during the squeeze. This is a waiting game for institutions and smart money. If you have the money and time to hold it would be smart or to make a position at there’s prices would also be smart. We wait for Cohen to turn the company around which would tell everyone who’s shorting this company that it will be fair valued at $100 and they (*shorts*) would not be able to bankrupt the company or get the share price back to where they or originally shorted it.

TL;DR - HF still have to initiate MOASS. Not yet though people need to hold for Cohen to take action and creat a positive outlook for the company, HF wouldn’t want to pay interest on a company whose valuation will be going up for years. They would unwind.

DD: Why GME Valuation is valid at $300+?,158,lbkyne,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbkyne/dd_why_gme_valuation_is_valid_at_300/,44,1612377886,"The 2020 pandemic year and onward has been the year of insane valuations. Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.

The results must have been known since mit December and substantial parts of the results already in November! Remember the last person for phase 1 was recruited in November and primary completion of the study in early December !

And again - phase 1 is an open label study (no blinding for anybody !). Vaxart knows the data the very moment when their laboratory machines give their results (e.g neutralising antibody titers from an ELISA Test)

Vaxart must know the results since many weeks.

Why does it take so long? Phase 1 is a relatively small study. The reason is the talks which are behind the scene. While we get Hamster results, I am confident that Vaxart had several meetings with OWS and WHO COVAX committee talking about large multi hundred million dose production.

It is only consistent that Vaxart is hiring so many highly qualified and well paid staff as indicated on their website: all prepared for large scale production. Contractor is secured as well. All is set.

I would not even exclude that we may not get phase 1 results today before the conference if anything is still to be negotiated between Vaxart and OWS or Vaxart and WHO. This could even further delay the announcement.

It is also possible that we first get phase 1 results today before the NY Academie of science meeting and then followed in some days by OWS and/or WHO announcement.

In any case if we do not get news Premarket - this would be indicative that something very big goes on behind the scene. But zero doubt that the phase 1 data would disappoint.

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

Listen up, it's late as hell and I want to get this off my mind. 

There's been many comments and posts saying to get off this journey before you loose too much. Yes, I agree - get out if you're on the verge of eviction and need to pay your fucking rent to survive. 

But we're drifting off a clear direction. Yes, we're all looking to profit and take some tendies home. But the fact that DFV didn't sell everything proves that the direction of this movement has changed. It's not all about profits anymore. It's about exposing the game we're playing and the rules set. 

Sure we can play the same game for years and follow advice from r/stocks or r/investing and take our 10% yearly profits. But this isn't what this fucking sub was about. 

!!THIS SUB HAS NEVER BEEN A SOURCE FOR FINANCIAL ADVICE!!

Millions of new people joined this sub and thought everyone's becoming a millionaire but never saw a loss porn in their life til recently. 

So let's take a step back and see what we've accomplished and what we can accomplish further.

We've disrupted the media, Wall Street, and even politics. What did we find out? That there's so many behind the door rules that we don't know about. 

When Elon asked Vlad what the formula is that determines the cost of the Clearinghouse operates, the Robinhood CEO doesn't have a clear answer. He just states that the people behind those doors are good guys and that volatility is a big role. He goes out to defend them but doesn't explain clearly the rules of the game as to how the numbers add up. Take it from an engineer, if 1+1 is not 2, that bridge is held by fucking twigs and will collapse during the next 100year flood. 

Now what about the logic behind shorts decreasing from over 100% to 50%? The price of the stock kept going down from weird transactions with the trading volume so low. 

It doesn't make sense. And we need an explanation. We're playing a numbers game where the rules are set by people that are keeping the rules from the Public. And with that, how the hell can the normal working person live a life with financial freedom?? 

We the people are large enough to seek an answer. It's time the people behind closed doors stop controlling the rules they set to keep themselves comfortable while risking our daily livelihoods. Their actions affect us too much and we need to find a way to separate from their chokehold.

GME: Calm the Fuck Down,440,lbk9gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbk9gg/gme_calm_the_fuck_down/,53,1612374836,"Let me start this by saying that I have GME and I’m holding. I very much want it to go back up and I think it will. But it’s going to take a while. 

Stop with the posts that say “the last time it went to $112, it then jumped to 420.69”. Even if that were true: so what? You can’t use past behavior to predict what is going to happen, especially here in this particular case and especially when that past history is a week ago. 

Also, stop with the magical TA posts. It’s great that you have crayons, but drawing random lines doesn’t mean the stock is going to follow the pattern you think you see. Especially in a period of high volatility.

The short squeeze may not even happen (or maybe it did and fizzled, though I don’t think so). There’s no law that says it must. It won’t happen unless there’s a reason shorts have to sell en masse.

I get it, confirmation of your biases feels good. But living your life that way is begging for disappointment. 

For posters: would you post your predictions if it meant a permanent ban if your prediction was wrong?

For readers: do you think posters would post their optimistic predictions if it meant risking a permanent ban from the sub?

Calm down. It could still get very bloody and if you’re holding, you might have to do so for a long time.

We can potentially cause the entire situation to blow up. Imagine a situation where at least half the sub buys at least one stock in the same day guess what happens the couple of hundred of shares in the short ladder attack don't matter anymore and due to the low float we could easily see a price increase of over 200% in a single day which will inevitably cause some paper hand shorts to cover causing the short squeeze 2.0.

TLDR; Buying on low float can easily cause GME to double or triple in a single day causing Short squeeze 2.0

EDIT4: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED AS SUCH, I ALSO DO NOT CONDONE THE COORDINATED PURCHASE OF ANY STOCK OR EQUITY.

There were many 🦍 who delivered the morning 🧻 route directly onto the lawns of those who scripted the headlines the night before. The question is though, *how many* 🦍? How many 🦍delivered 🧻to the Hedge Fund's while they strolled out onto the front lawn of their mansions in their Ugg boots, sipping their freshly brewed covfefe.

Luckily for me that is all that I need.

Below you will see the Open, High, Low and Close for the past few weeks. Now, I'm no wrinkle brain but I see a lot of 0's for us dumb 🦍who randomly mash 'buy at market'.

This is us, the diamond hands, standing our ground next to the King DFV]",224,lbjv0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbjv0f/motivation_wednesday_gme_my_diary_notes_remember/,38,1612373067,"Day three of the second week of the fight.

Dear diary,

Last week we had seen some shit in the market. Brokers shut down the American free market for some time. The whole world talked about us at first, but then the attacks began.

We were marked as market manipulators. However, we had support. By millionaires, billionaires and politicians. Soon we weren’t market manipulators anymore, but people who saved businesses.

However, the HF were smart. They had a crisis meeting and changed the narrative. They took positions in SLV and then called their friend at the news outlets. They changed the narrative from a GME squeeze to a silver squeeze. The whole day everybody on mainstream media talked about fucking SLV. But we kept strong, we fought the fake news with facts until they stopped talking about it. During this attack we lost some men who switched to SLV.

However, then Friday came. The HF started their short ladder attacks. At first we did not recognize these attacks. We didn’t know how to defend ourselves, then to stay together, buy the dips and shut our eyes from the reds. A lot of options were in the call and it costed them millions.

The HF called all their quants this weekend. They picked some PhD students from Harvard, Stanford and Oxford and made their plans. They did the math, analysed WSB and then knew what to do: *WSB grew from 2.2 million to 8.4 million in a week. Most of these people are not retarded enough to hold the stocks if they lose 5%. So lets continue the short ladder attacks and let them fear the big money.*

And that’s what happened on Monday. They regrouped and started the attack… We lost a lot of apes on Monday. Then the second attack on Tuesday. I must say, I almost cried. A lot of people left the fight. They told their wife’s boyfriends that he will become a millionaire, but lost a couple of hundreds, so they left the fight. At the end of the day there were only a couple of diamond handed people left. Moral is low. On twitter we called for our Daddy Ryan Cohen, however, no response…

But then the post of u/DFV. After topping an unrealized return of 48 million, he lost approximately half during this weeks fight. He came with his post and showed us that he will continue the fight with or without us. The most loyal to DFV and GME are staying now. Me too. DFV showed me how to become rich, he gave me a taste, something I never had. Now, I will stay until the end.

This reminds me of the fight of the 300 Spartans against the Persians. During the first fights everybody stayed and fought successfully. But then when King Leonidas wanted to continue for freedom and respect, a majority of his soldiers left. Only the most loyal and strong stayed. This is us now in this moment. The loyal and strong Spartans are the Diamond Hands. Our king is DFV and our fight is against the strong HF. We might die, but that does not matter. Because in the end we showed them our strength and saved GME.

BTW Mods, maybe make a motivation flair?

Another Perspective for GME,157,lbjle0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbjle0/another_perspective_for_gme/,43,1612371880,"This truly is a long play (I know, obviously — but want to write it out for people worried or on the fence). I think GME didn’t issue more shares at the inflated prices because it would have angered retail and risked even the slightest thought of GME also being a bad guy — given the intense amount of people on the hype train and the Twitter storms etc. It also would have given institutions a legit reason to drive price down.

I think Ryan Cohen and crew are waiting for this to die down, lose media attention, and let the price bottom out and consolidate before they continue to announce things. I also don’t think they’ll do a share offering until a couple of quarters from now (when price has risen steadily but big). The more I think about this, the more I think it’ll end up like TSLA. I think GME is about to have a stellar year or next two years, while squeezing shorts to <10% gradually. Shorts also won’t give up until GME starts putting up consecutive, big earnings numbers and milestones; just like Tesla did. 

I believe Ryan Cohen will turn this company around. He is proud (and rightfully so) of how he built Chewy and is clearly a success-driven leader. I am sure he is already getting excited to come out of this as the hero (just like Elon). 

A few popular DD’s were posted about this but last Thursday nearly (I think missed by minutes) triggered an explosive move and the real squeeze of GME. Now that it has been suppressed, I unfortunately believe a rapid squeeze won’t happen; and again, I think GME will rise steadily — and have some big weeks this year. I know it’s not the confirmation bias we all seek, but there has been some solid level-headed DD come out recently and I think if people aren’t setup for the long haul, they need to take a step back and position for that. For example: imagine getting in TSLA at $200 with a ton of shares and LEAPs; now, those folks are sitting on +300% gains and know the true meaning of holding long. 

Position: 3/19 175c (will be cutting soon and pushing out expiry) & 30 shares (avg. cost $172)

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap.",03-02-2021 19:04,41,1413,negative,-0.5423,positive

In this post I will provide my reasons why I am holding through lockup and why I think starting to scale in before earnings and lockup is a good idea (Also I am a retard so don't take anything I say seriously).

&#x200B;

1. Having earnings before the market open usually means that earnings is bullish, or so I have heard, because management is confident enough in the quarterly numbers to not give the market time to digest them. With all of the new contracts PLTR's🚀 earnings should be a healthy beat.
2. February 16th is the last day for institutions to file their 13F with the SEC to let everyone know what they have bought or sold for the 4th quarter. I am guessing based off of PLTR's🚀 run this past quarter that many institutions have taken up position and that will be revealed on the 16th/17th. The reveal of these big buyers will cause a bit of fomo and look bullish, giving the market reaction to earnings a bullish bias.
3. Just because something like 80% (I have seen % ranging from 80 to \~66%) of locked up shares will be available to trade doesn't mean insiders will actually sell. We know that at the very least Karp and Peter are planning on holding shares/ownership stake through private investment firms that they own (Mithril Capital Management). That said there should be selling pressure... the obvious play. 
4. PLTR🚀 is currently \~31% off of it's intraday high from 4 days ago! There has been heavy shorting on low volume going on before yesterday's official earnings announcement. Now that we have a set date and the uncertainty has been removed we could see a bit of a run up into earnings. This is currently, in my opinion, providing a good entry point that may not last. 

The fear of lockup is probably worse than the actual event.

I will likely hold for at least a year unless PLTR🚀 decides to moon and free me from my 9-5.

I've been a member of this sub for a long time. I know this post is going to get downvoted, but I've got to make it because I am very concerned that we could have a wave of self harm urges depending on the way GME moves.

Please. For the love of everything... be careful. Control your risk. Control the size of your positions and what you're willing to lose. I am seeing posts about people throwing in a million at levels above 200 or 250. Saying that it's everything they've made in the past few years, or maybe it's margin, or maybe it's their ira or savings.

Eventually this has to come down. Every single spike like this has. Nothing moves from 20 to 470 in a few days and stays there. Going to 1000? Because Volkswagen did? There's no reason to believe that it will and if it does, that candle wick top could be a small amount of shares. Please, PLEASE... just don't trade more than you can lose. I really am hoping with every fiber of my being that this thing shatters the moon and goes to mars for all of you. 

Once the collapse starts the order book could quickly evaporate. You could become trapped very easily and if you're anywhere above 100$ a share the odds of it coming back are extremely slim should this follow Volkswagen. They stayed under 30 for a decade once it was over. And it did end, and fast.

When things are extremely euphoric it's incredibly difficult to tell where you are at in the process. I don't know what's going to happen. What I do know, is that there's going to be some of us in bad shape, for one reason or the other.

I've been a trader for years. I've been a member here for quite a long time. I am making this post not to tell you what to do, but to recommend you manage what you do right now.

Some people are betting such large amounts so high up that they could find themselves in a mental break if they have bad luck. These kinds of movements are super exciting, but getting trapped with a large amount or margin amount high up on a flimsy spike can lead to self harm.

Which is why I want to urge you to use the hotline. If you're in a very bad place right now, please, use the hotline. Please don't use a permanent solution.

I love all of you guys. I love the memes you make. This part of the internet has been my favorite place for a long time. And I want all of us to keep making memes and having fun. Please be safe.",03-02-2021 18:21,74,2399,positive,0.6249,positive

Brief Thoughts on GME,67,lbixik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbixik/brief_thoughts_on_gme/,51,1612368850,"""by the mere fact that he forms part of an organised crowd, a man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian—that is, a creature acting by instinct.""

Firstly, a few things:

1. People are here to make money, getting too attached to a stock by emotion and not rational analysis is not the way, as individuals, we should be looking to make plays with the maximum reward adjusted for risk (multi-baggers are nice, but what is the probability of it happening in each case? consistency is better). So if you can't defend your thesis, or even have a thesis on your position, you shouldn't hold or even buy. Sticking it up to wall street or buying it because everyone is doing can convince you to buy, but it's not a thesis. Understanding the opposite side of your trade and their thesis is an important part of this.
2. In order to have any sort of reasonable discussion, the participants need to agree on a common factual basis, and the scientific method in that anything can be disproven if given enough evidence. If data is a part of your argument, the source is of the essence. People laugh at antivaxx or flat earth groups, but they do the same thing (be dismissive and ignore all evidence against their beliefs) when it comes to ""truths"" they hold dear.
3. All investments are fundamentally a matter of price. The best company can be overvalued and the worst undervalued. The same GME is obviously a radically different investment when your average is 40 vs 400 for the individual who is investing. Let's say both embraces the possibility of losing their money, and aim for 1000. Well with the same probability of succeeding the odds are 1:25 and 1:2.5. There are much more opportunities in the market for 2.5 baggers than 25 baggers.

The Bear Case hinges on:

Given the amount of information at hand, what is the fundamental value of GME right now, how much should one price in Cohen succeeding in transforming the business? Those who short will be using fundamentals, since the momentum of the short-squeeze will eventually revert to a fair price. What that fair price is is debatable. How long that reversion happens will depend on the relative positioning of longs and shorts. But is likely that institutions have little faith in the ability of retail traders (who are majority long) to diamond hands.

So if you agree with the following:

1. GME is currently overvalued.
2. The short interest is low relative adjusted for time and probability of GME reverting back to fair value due to retail investors being fundamentally feeble: institutions are willing to hold much longer (see how much Melvin Capital blew up on their positions) until their thesis play out versus people who may not even have a thesis (not necessarily WSB, but retail who got sucked in past few weeks in general).

Then it obviously makes sense to short, some firms may have blown up themselves shorting at much lower levels, but other firms may have seen GME as an extremely attractive target while it soared past 40 and into the hundreds, there were even people on CNBC who blatantly said they were opening put positions, so this isn't much of a leap in faith.

My thoughts:

I would much rather put my money on the fundamental value of GME expanding rather than betting on a low probability event happening (the easy money has already been made, stop being greedy thinking GME making another 20x is at the same conditions as the last 20x). If we put the short-squeeze out of the equation, the drop from 469 is making GME rapidly approach a level where the risk-reward ratio based on fundamentals is something I'm comfortable with.

TLDR: Best time to enter/add is when the fundamental bull case for GME stands on its own, looking to enter around 40 where I will diamond hands until more signs of whether Cohen will succeed or fail in turning GME around (which will be a 10-20 bagger based on around 3B valuation)

positions: Sold 20C at cost basis 11 on 1100 shares so call me retarded

EDIT:

Anyone who thinks I'm bearish on GME is retarded and has not read the post. I have great faith in Cohen, but it's not a certainty, I am opening a position with a favorable risk rewards ratio with regards to how likely I think GME is to succeed in the next year to next few years.",03-02-2021 18:14,21,4340,neutral,0,positive
How and why NOK will reach the moon?,263,lbitv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbitv7/how_and_why_nok_will_reach_the_moon/,59,1612368388,"NOK will colonize the moon and bring 4G to barbaric aliens! NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)

First, in regards to Nokia’s business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn’t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia’s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. 

[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn’t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won’t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer’s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump’s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don’t think this is likely. But it’s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth.

Shout out to I am absolutely rooting for y’all and all your proletarian tendies.

&nbsp;

I don’t want to rain on anyone’s money parade. But after reading lots of excited posts about “rockets to the moon”, which seem to be full of excited confirmation bias, riding on [this excellent & sober post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/), I wanted to present a few arguments, as a total ignorant fool, about some strategic disadvantages I perceive in this battle, since I tend towards skepticism, and worry that there is too much buzz, and not enough strategic preparation.

&nbsp;


I was also inspired by [u/NHNE](https://www.reddit.com/user/NHNE)’s quote from Sun Tzu in his excellent post with a [Diamond Hand Strategy Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahcsd/comprehensive_gme_diamond_hand_strategy_guide/): 

*“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” - Sun Tzu*

&nbsp;
 
**My caveat: I know literally nothing about investing.**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


***The advantages Hedge Funds have in the battle for the GME Short Squeeze:***

&nbsp;


**Information advantage**

- The hedge funds will always have quicker, better access to information than all of WSB. 

**Coordination advantage**

- They are one big organized entity, and can move their entire “Army” of bets with infinitesimal speed. 

**Size advantage**

- The hedges have more money at stake and in play than all of WSB put together.

**Ally advantage**

- They have powerful collaborators. The media, who doesn’t want a hedge fund to go bust. You can assume, the US government (and every other government), because they don’t want a stock market crash. And everyone who colludes with hedge funds, i.e. all of corporate America.

**Propaganda advantage**

- Whether it be social media posts, bots, articles in mainstream media, they have enough money to blast out as much fake statistics and propaganda as they like. WSB does not.
 
**Mathematical advantage**

- A lot of trading has become complicated math. You can assume that every single analyst they have/need is working on the math to get them out of the hole they have dug themselves in. We are less good at math.

**Speed & Precision advantage**

- They can make trades and bets much faster, with a much higher precision than WSB.

**Strategic advantage**

- You can assume the hedge funds know your position, but you don’t know theirs. This in my mind is the most powerful of all advantages for them. Imagine you are playing chess against an opponent and have to decide which pieces to move, but aren’t allowed to see where theirs are? But they can ever *read your thoughts* (i.e. this forum).

**Legal advantage**

- Given the very very light penalties even for something patently illegal in financial manipulations, it is in their very interest to do anything whose cost is “cheaper” than the potential cost of the actual monetary loss, whether it be legal or not. If you were the CEO/Fund manager, you too would decide for illegality.

&nbsp;


So, the question then becomes, given this situation, in which for the hedge funds not only billions are at stake, but the narrative of their ability to make the market, and the propaganda of expertise they disseminate, how does WSB win and force the Short Squeeze? What are WSB's advantages? How do you make best use of them? Who are WSB's allies? How can they be activated? How do you deceive the enemy? How do you overwhelm them, tactically?

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

A few initial thoughts on counter-strategies (Feel free to suggest more, and I'll add them in):

- The strongest narrative that might influence public/politics is that the stock market is a casino, and the house is not just taking its fees, but cheating. The stock market is no longer a ""free market"", but a place where big players make the rules, and use their wealth to make more wealth for themselves.

- WSB needs to find and activate allies. These might be the company itself (GME), value investors who believe in the free market and its efficiency, political/investment figures who want investment to actually mean something.

- Some disadvantages need to be turned into disadvantages. For example, it will be difficult to impossible for WSB to move in concert without alerting the ""enemy"" to its own ovements. So, how does one coordinate a move in which transparency becomes an advantage?

Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Short Stocks and Dividend Payments 

Shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.

1 -﻿ If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises to $512.00 there is a LOSS. The stock needs to be BORROWED from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any DIVIDENDS.

&#x200B;

2﻿ - If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are NOT entitled to the dividend.

&#x200B;

3 -﻿ In fact, the investor is instead responsible for PAYING the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.

Special Considerations:

Shorting stocks are considered RISKY and appropriate only for sophisticated traders (MELVIN IS A DUMBASS) due to the general upward trend of stocks, borrowing costs, and the skewed risk-reward nature of shorting. Over time, stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies. Companies, through their business operations, protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers. This is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time.

&#x200B;

Borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock, typically between 2% and 10% annually. **30% in exceptional cases**.

&#x200B;

4﻿ -﻿ Of course, there is the additional cost of paying out DIVIDENDS. This is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task. Finally, **BASIC MATH** works against short selling as well. A stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some INNOVATIVE product.

Do the the skeptical claims about GME even make sense?,331,lbi6em,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbi6em/do_the_the_skeptical_claims_about_gme_even_make/,80,1612365524,"Alright, I'm not going to pretend that I have a deep understanding of finance, but some of the comments expressing skepticism about GME reek of pure bullshit. Here's some of the recent claims I've been seeing.

**1. The shorts have covered!**

The poster usually cites the massive drop in SI as reported by S3. Something like \~120% going into Friday, down to \~51% going into Monday. So, from a basic supply & demand analysis, this doesn't add up. Volume was relatively low compared to Mo/Tues/Wed and the prior week, most likely due to heavy restrictions (or outright bans) on buying GME shares on brokerages who ran into liquidity issues. If it were true that the shorts closed a massive portion of their short positions—purportedly \~70%—on Friday, then we would've seen a massive hike in price because shorts would've been scrambling to buy, along with the few institutional/retail investors who weren't restricted from buying. This basically would've been the squeeze. But that's not what happened. The price did increase, yes, but it didn't massively spike, not to the degree that it would have had the shorts legitimately bought back shares *en masse,* as is being claimed.

**2. Sure, but that just means that new shorts opened up at the top, that's why the price didn't spike to squeeze levels!**

No, this can't be correct. If enough new short positions were opened Friday to artificially suppress and ""hide"" the supposed *massive* covering of short positions, then the SI reported by S3 would not have gone down—at least, it would not have decreased from \~120% to 51%. At this point, claims 1 and 2 aren't even compatible. They can't both be true at the same time. My guess is shorts have been ""averaging up"" their short positions the entire time in a rolling fashion. Everyone knows the price will crash after the squeeze happens, so it seems unlikely that shorts who were willing to risk bankruptcy over this would suddenly throw their hands up, cover most of their positions (even if it were possible in this short time period) and then not take out new positions at the height to recoup losses on the way down. It would seem more likely that the SI hasn't actually decreased much at all, much less over the past 4 trading days.

**3. The shorts closed/are closing their positions this week! (Mo/Tues)**

Again, I don't see how this would work. How could shorts be closing *en masse* while the stock price is in free fall, like it has been the last two days? When shorts close their shorted shares, they buy the stock. So, if the claim is that they've been closing their earlier short positions this week, then shouldn't we realistically have seen an increase in price? Especially with Monday's low volume? At the very least, the price should've stabilized, not plummeted.

It seems literally impossible for a massive buy back of borrowed shares to have occurred over the past 4 trading days while SI supposedly plummeted **and** without the price spiking to infinity, especially when those days were relatively low in volume in comparison to the days leading up to them.  One or more of these claims has to be false, right?

Maybe they did massively cover and new short positions were opened to suppress/crash the price simultaneously. In that case, SI should've stayed relatively stable or gone up, not crash from previous estimates.

If the SI really did crash, meaning shorts massively covered their outstanding positions, then price should've erupted.

If we just ignore the estimated SI entirely and assume that the shorts covered a while ago, and the spike at the AH last week was ""the squeeze."" That doesn't make sense though because why would shorts have tried to exit by buying back shares at the height of international attention? Between the shorts buying mass amounts of shares to cover and the gigantic wave of new retail investors wanting to get in on the squeeze, the price would've exploded well beyond what was achieved because who the fuck would've been selling at that point? What seems more likely is that the AH was simply a result of the insane media coverage and bullish hype drawing in lots of new long investors, both retail and institutional.

Hopefully someone can explain what I'm missing because I feel like I'm going crazy reading all this skeptical shit when half of it contradicts the other half.  I realize there are legitimate concerns regarding GME moving forward, but it seems like much of the original squeeze thesis is still viable.

First thing: In my 8 years trading for Wall street firms I never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with GME. In fact the only time I ever found myself naked short (accidentally) it was a huge problem, was almost fired, massive apologies to the prime broker, exchange, regulators etc. I certainly didn't make that mistake again. I can tell you that in Europe and Asia this kind of shit just doesn't fly. However, having seen the GME fail-to-deliver data on the SEC website, I'm pretty shocked that US markets appear to be riddled with corruption.

Second thing: If you're a trader or PM in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately. You never let an error run or dilly-dally before making things right. It's my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry. Ego, right or wrong, fair or unfair, they all go out the window and you take the loss, suffer the pain, and live to fight another day. 

Now let's consider what happened last week: GME  traded > 500m shares. If Melvin were covering at 1/4 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares. That's twice the floating market cap. As such I'd say Melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already.

In that case, you're all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers (eToro et al) running stops of leveraged customers. The only way to fix this is for retail to stop buying GME derivatives and instead buy real stock and hold.

Happy to hear any evidence that they're still short but beware the integrity of such data.

we look back at a special week with unprecedented developments in stocks like GameStop or AMC.

We want to personally apologize to you, if you have been affected by the buy restrictions on those stocks! We haven’t done a great job explaining the reasoning behind our decisions. Below we answer many questions that you have asked us in the past days.

Those decisions were difficult and within a special market environment. Eventually, we failed to explain our thoughts to you and didn't get to the bottom of the problem in our communication. Some of you criticized us for our actions, others have been understanding. Thank you.

We have not managed to live up to your expectations towards a modern, democratic and free broker. We will continue to work very hard to improve things, while trying to be open, transparent, clear and to the point.

We started Trade Republic five years ago to build a better bank. We are excited that you are a part of Trade Republic’s community. Part of a group that empowers people across Europe to have easy, fast and free access to capital markets.

Many thanks
Christian, Thomas & Marco
Founders of Trade Republic



Why did Trade Republic stop buy orders for stocks like GameStop or AMC on Thursday?

We started the last week with new highs in transactions, active customers and without any problems. On Thursday, shortly after 7:30 a.m., our trading venue Lang & Schwarz Exchange (LSX) suffered from a significant outage. This was due to database overloads at one of LSX's service providers. We then switched to our fallback trading venue Tradegate Exchange. After a few hours, the tremendous increase of orders in stocks such as GameStop or AMC led to delays in the execution of orders. Trading had to be temporarily suspended to increase capacity.

Trading started again in the afternoon. This was followed by another heavy load on the systems with several thousand orders per minute. To prevent further outages, we decided not to accept any buy orders for six stocks, including GameStop and AMC, after the XETRA close at 5:30 p.m. We decided to do this to ensure the availability of our service for our customers. There were concerns that there could have been rapid declines in prices for stocks such as GameStop and AMC in the wake of particularly high volatility. Technical delays could have resulted in losses for you. That’s what we were referring to when mentioning “risks to you” in our first message.


Why did Trade Republic block only buy and not sell orders for those six stocks?

Essentially, the additional number of orders for those six stocks overloaded the systems. However, we wanted to continue to allow sell transactions. It was important to us to give customers who held those highly volatile stocks the opportunity to sell the shares to take profits or limit losses.


Why was the limitation of trading lifted again on Friday?

We worked through the night and our team massively scaled up our resources. Our tests have shown that the systems remain stable even with a considerable order load. As a result, we decided to start full trading on Friday before the market opened at 7:30 a.m. On Friday we again saw peak activities but our systems ran without problems.


Why do you say in the first message that you want to protect the customers from risks?

Trade Republic stands for free access to the capital market and offers various asset classes. We do not want to tell our users what to invest in. Our first message to our customers was misleading. We did not distinguish well enough between the explanation (technical risks) and the information (risks of volatile stocks). At Trade Republic, many people are investing their money in stocks for the first time. Due to the unique events in the markets, we wanted to inform about the risks associated with volatile stocks for our customers who are invested in those. More risk information will be added to the app in the future.


Has BaFin ordered the resumption of trading?

No. Trade Republic is in constant exchange with the BaFin. Trade Republic has informed BaFin about the steps mentioned above. The decision to resume trading was made independently by Trade Republic. Contrary to media claims, Trade Republic was not admonished about non-compliance with regulation by the BaFin on Thursday. Following incidents and outages, Trade Republic continues to report to the supervisory authority and provides comprehensive information on the case.


Can something like this happen again?

Our systems easily coped with the maximum load of trading last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as Friday. Without the technical error of the service provider at Lang & Schwarz Exchange, Thursday would have also been a quiet, normal day. As a result, we have greatly increased our server capacity and load testing. At the same time, we are investing massively in our technical infrastructure to improve our offering further.


Has Trade Republic responded to third-party pressure? Does Trade Republic have relationships with hedge funds?

No. Trade Republic has never had and does not have any relationships with hedge funds or similar market participants. The decision was made by Trade Republic independently and only from a technical point of view.


Did Trade Republic respond to pressure from clearing houses? Were there liquidity bottlenecks?

No. Trade Republic settles all transactions with HSBC - one of the largest settlement providers in the world. There were no limitations in clearing & settlement in any way. Trade Republic does not have to maintain liquidity for clearing.


Does Trade Republic sell data to hedge funds so they can trade against it to make money (""frontrunning"")?

No. Trade Republic conducts its trades through the Hamburg Stock Exchange which is controlled by a supervisory authority appointed by the Hamburg Senate. Trade Republic does not sell any data to third parties. Trading takes place at reference market prices, e.g. from XETRA. Different to what is claimed in the media, the business model of Trade Republic is not comparable to the model of Robinhood.


Does Trade Republic lend out my securities?

No. Trade Republic never lends out securities.

His girlfriend was deeply asleep next to him. She had come home late again last night after hanging out with Jake, the guy she jokingly called her boyfriend.

When GME goes to the moon and I get my tendies, she’s going to love me again!

His phone vibrated loudly on the nightstand next to him.
“I’m outside,” the text preview said. Fuck!

His brother, Charles, was outside. He had completely forgotten about the family brunch - a long-standing tradition that was usually a monthly occurrence. The pandemic had pushed their brunch plans and it had now been six months since their last reunion.

He clumsily climbed out of bed. He found his jeans from last night on the floor and jumped into them. They were the only jeans that still fit him. The lightly colored denim was starting to fade. He picked a black tee shirt that was loose enough to hide his pandemic gut. It had deodorant stains, so he knew his arms would be glued his sides all day.

He watered his thinning hair. He sprinted back into the bedroom.

“Bye, baby! I’ll see you after my family brunch.""
He leaned in to kiss her cheek but she, annoyed, dug her head deeper into the pillow so that she could keep sleeping.
He gulped at the purple bruise with teeth marks on the side of her neck.

The black Model S was sparkling in the sun. Their father bought it for Charles as a reward for getting accepted into the same neurosurgery fellowship their father trained at.
“That’s what you’re wearing?” Charles laughed.
“Ha ha yeah my other clothes are in the wash.”

His brothers biceps were bulging through the expensive shirt he was wearing. A water bottle condensed onto the cup holders. Charles was the family prodigy and exuded confidence in every step.

The drive to their parents house consisted of shallow catch-up small talk. He kept his hands on his laps the entire time in order to hide the Dorito stains on them.

                          -----   

“What the fuck do you mean you’re out of money, Dale?!” His father bellowed.
Images of $5,000 of expired PLTR YOLO calls came to mind.
If I had picked the expiration date for two weeks later, I’d be rich right now...
The other $5,000 his father gave him went into GameStop stock. He bought at the top, which was $350 dollars per share. It was now sitting at $80 per share.

They said I’d make tendies! They said it was free fucking money. There’s no way it could’ve gone tits up. Diamond hands prevai-

“Did you spend it all on the fucking stock market again?”
There’s no way out. I’m fucked. I don’t have any money. I need to tell him.

“Yes.”
“WHAT THE FUCK! You fucking degenerate!”
Charles was snickering next to him with his cell phone aimed at Dale. He was recording him. Susan, their sister, was blushing and looking at her phone. Their mother was embarrassed and looked worried.

Don’t give Charles a satisfying reaction. Stay cool. Diamond hands, baby.

""Dad. It's different this time! The shorts are ladder trading right now which is artificially bringing the price down. Plus, the short squeeze is coming any day now!""

He had no idea what ladder trading was. A user named u/PM_Me_Vagina_pics wrote that in a thread he saw earlier. Dale didn't even understand what a short squeeze was or how it worked. He barely grasped what puts and calls were and that's because Robinhood made it easy to do.

""You think you can beat billionaires at their own game?"" his dad hissed through clenched teeth. His jugular vein was bulging. Or was that his carotid vein?
I'll ask Charles later! He'll know.

""Yes! If we all hold on to our stock there is no way tha-""

“FUCK!”
His dad pounded his fists and left the table.

It wasn't even 11 AM and Dale had already ruined the day. Mother was mortified. Susan was scarlet. And Charles was chortling.

Most men would fold under the deep shame of being called a degenerate by their father. But Dale was not like most men. He took a bite of his blueberry waffles and pretended they were chicken tenders.
Yummy!

A small fire was alive inside of Dale. The spark of that flame came from a meme that made him giggle earlier. In the meme, there was a picture of a chimp. Or perhaps it was an ape? It was the caption, however, that captivated Dale and gave him the confidence to buy 500 more dollars worth of Gamestop stock. The caption read:

Start of part deux of the GME short squeeze,147,lbhmsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbhmsd/start_of_part_deux_of_the_gme_short_squeeze/,33,1612363197,"""**If  long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new buying opportunity,  we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short squeeze.By Ihor Dusaniwsky**

**The momentum against GameStop picked up on  Tuesday morning as the short-squeeze rallies fueled by traders on  Reddit's** r/WallStreetBets **forum started to unwind. Shares of the retail  investor favorite were sent tumbling as hedge funds and Reddit traders  alike were left to wonder what’s to come for the volatile stock.**

**Yesterday, GME saw continued short covering,  but to a much smaller extent than it had experienced over the last few  days. With today’s stock price weakness, we should expect short covering  to be minimal, with the possibility that momentum shorts jump into the  trade. Stock borrow availability has increased so shorts are once again  able to add on to or initiate short positions.**

**And GME’s fall may not be over: What may  exacerbate its stock slide are long shareholders trimming their holdings  and realizing some of the unrealized gains they’ve earned as GME’s  stock price skyrocketed.**

**S3 data helps tell the whole story. Now, GME  short interest is $5.81 billion, with 26.09 million shares shorted.  Traditional SI % Float is down significantly from its highs in the  140’s% at the beginning of January. The SI % of Float is st 51.13% and  the S3 SI % of Float, which includes synthetic longs created by short  sales, is at 33.83%, telling us that there’s ample stock loan supply for  short sellers to access, should they want to short more shares. The  stock borrow fee on existing shorts is 19%, while the stock borrow fee  on new shorts is 10% to 20% fee.**

**Over the last week, the number of GME shares  shorted has decreased by -37.24 million shares, worth $8.4 billion, a  decrease of -59% as its stock price rose +193%. We saw just over 1  million shares covered yesterday. Shorts are down -$9.5 billion in  year-to-date mark-to-market losses, -278% for the year, and are up  +$3.08 billion in profits on today’s -52% price move ($107.00).**

**If long shareholders begin to sell their  positions, expect short sellers to jump in and help GME’s stock slide  continue. But if long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new  buying opportunity, we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short  squeeze.**

Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there's an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.

If there's one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it's that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you'd like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.

Hopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It's the most accessible and I'm all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren't investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you've already missed the ""value"" phase and you're basically banking on something that's hard to pin down.

It's a slippery basis for an investment, but it's made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here's the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won't get you to tendie town. That's trading, not investing, and trading doesn't work out well for most people.

The unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it's a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you're an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can't sell at the peak. I think it's all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren't approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you're like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.

I'd argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they're investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a ""movement"" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.

DFV didn't initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that's exactly what he has in common with WSB's other luminaries.

If you can see what the market doesn't yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that's the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you'll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that's the part of the road you're on right now, but it's a good start.

So now everyone is getting on the GME bandwagon because that’s how DFV made his money right? Yes, he did invest in GME but he did it by buying LEAPS. 

If you don’t know what LEAPS are they are options a year or more out. DFV bought low priced leaps and it paid off big time.  The thing is, in the last year, anyone could have basically invested in anything  and made a profit. 

The second thing he did was go big. Investing $100 isn’t going to change your life appreciably except in the most improbable circumstances. Risk what you can, but be willing to lose it all.

All that seems to become popular these past few days are diamond hand, 🦍 together strong means GME will go to the moon. 

Look I love the memes as much as the next autist, but it seems as this is the only content in the sub right now. That and the repetitive DD about short interest still being high, short ladder attacks, and lies in the media.

I know this is starting to sound negative, but I’m not a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 and believe in the OG GME DD, and am still holding my shares bought at $30, $140, and $240 levels, and I’m not fucking selling💎👐.

With that being said though I still have some questions about the future of GME and hope these questions might bring a bigger picture to rest of the sub. I’ll just list the questions below, looking forward to some answers.

1. What more can hedge funds do to drive down the price? We’ve seen the short latter attacks, lies in the media, bots in our own sub. These institutions aren’t going to back down and have the capital and capability to manipulate the market. So what else can we except going forward from these bastards?

2. Do retail investors have enough power against the hedge funds to come out on top? I’ve seen figures where retail own about 30% of GME, (please correct me if I’m wrong) but say that all 30% held is that enough to trigger the squeeze?

3. What is it like from the hedgies POV? They’re obviously trying to trigger selling to help their short position, but what exactly does their short position look like? I am not well-versed and short positions but know the basics. So they’ve borrowed shares that they eventually have buy back. What is the timeline on this? What is their penalty for delaying buying back the shares?

4. What exactly is happening with the brokerages and how much longer will this continue? Should have done more research on this, saw something about clearing houses, but can’t read too good. Why is RobinHood limiting orders? Is it due to hedge fund pressure or something else? Luckily I have been on TD and haven’t had problems, but majority of retail/WSB is on RH and these restrictions are hurting GME. What’s going to happen going forward with RH?

5. Realistically is the SEC going to do anything about the market manipulation, with either Hedge Funds or Brokerages? If so how will it help GME?

That’s all I got for now. I’ll update if I think of anything else. I apologize if these questions aren’t relevant, have already been answered or are just plain stupid. I am a truly a retard.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

Future of Manufacturing: Desktop Metal (DM): short term and long term play,65,lbgiy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbgiy0/future_of_manufacturing_desktop_metal_dm_short/,29,1612358844,"Hello fellow autistic children. I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.

Desktop Metal (DM) DD

DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.

The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.

Pros :

1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.

2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.

3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.

4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.

5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.

6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.

7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.

8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.

9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.

Cons :

1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.

2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc

(More cons are welcome)

My positions:

100 shares at $21.35

7 calls for $40 05/21,
9 calls for $35 05/21,
1 call for $20 05/21

Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!

Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.

PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read 😌,27,lbg9oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbg9oc/skt_dd_tanger_outlet_malls_value_play_please_read/,42,1612357867,"9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

Takeaways from GME - Where do we go from here?,124,lbg9ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbg9ha/takeaways_from_gme_where_do_we_go_from_here/,105,1612357846,"**The Free Market Isn't Free**

I have learned a lot in the last two weeks and I hope that some of you have as well. And I'm not talking about the fundamentals of investment, trading, or strategy. I'm talking about the mechanisms at play that tilt the market in favor of one group of people over another. Obviously this is an ever-evolving situation, but I think it's worthwhile to take the time to reflect on some of the key takeaways from the ordeal and start thinking about how we, both as a community and as individuals, can protect ourselves against falling prey to the same mistakes twice.

I'm not going to comment on whether there was intentional market manipulation on the part of hedge funds through all of this. It's immaterial to my thesis. What was exposed, first and foremost in my mind, is the uneven playing field that exists between institutional and retail investors. If possible, we should seek to find a way to negate those advantages and/or mirror them for the retail investor. I'll get into some ideas as to how this might be achieved later, but first let's dig into the advantages themselves.


**Advantages Afforded to the Institutional Investor**

*Access to Assets* 

One of the fundamental assumptions of the free market is that equal access to assets ought to be provided to those with means to purchase those assets. Hence, there is an expectation that brokerages act in all cases as a neutral party, an arbiter between a buyer and seller meeting on equal footing. The events of last Thursday show us this is not the case. Many, if not most brokerages, restricted access to an in-demand asset, leading to an artificial decrease in the value of that product as retail was allowed to sell freely, but not to buy freely. Again, this is not commentary on whether or not this was an intended effect, only an observation that it was the effect that occurred. In my opinion RH had so little liquidity available they would never have been able to handle the volume and were fucked either way.

Institutional investors do not rely on brokerages the same way a retail investor does, instead trading directly between one another. This creates a sub-market that exists direct-to-seller that retail investors couldn't dream of. As such, they have much more control over the actual trading they take part in. Moreover, insofar as the possibility of a restriction exists on those that fit a particular profile that cannot exist on those who fit another profile, it creates a situation that can warp supply and demand on a macro scale.

*Access to Information*

This one is quite a bit simpler. Institutional investors have access to algorithms that can predict and execute on market moves, up-to-the-millisecond data on market-wide trends, in some cases even access to trends in buy and sell limits that can inform how best to execute their next big move. In short, while the data accessible to the retail investor is improving at a rapid rate, it pales in comparison to that available to the institutional investor.

*Access to Capital*

The impact of the disparity in access to capital manifests itself primarily in three ways:

First, the sheer amount of capital that these institutional investors can draw from affords them the ability to single-handedly impact the market for a stock. This is why GME went down into the low single digits to begin with (along with the help of what were almost definitely buck naked shorts, which are illegal as fuck). This ability to move the market is an even greater advantage when you consider the ramifications of the fact that what the people of this subreddit have been attempting in trying to execute the People's Short Squeeze™ is essentially the same thing. So in that sense we're on an even playing field, right? Wrong. In order for our side to achieve the desired effect, we have to have a level of solidarity and commitment to the plan that in most cases is completely unachievable. As soon as a critical mass of diamond hands become paper hands, the whole thing falls apart. Now imagine what would have happened if Melvin weren't a single source of capital and instead a collection of millions of individuals each with their own free will. Realistically, half of them would have paper-handed out long before they shorted 140% of the free float of GME and this whole situation would never have gotten to this point.

Second, access to capital is only increased when you consider the willingness of others with just as much capital to bail institutional investors out when their position is all but dead. This is how you end up with the onholy trinity that is Citron/Citadel/Melvin all playing the same short position on the bet that there can't possibly enough capital on the receiving end of their play to make them lose. There is nothing even close to this kind of networking available to the retail investor.

Finally, access to capital renders regulatory fines effectively meaningless. If institutional investors can break the law in order to save their firm billions and it only costs them a few million, you'd better believe they'll do it every time. Their business is built on maximizing profit at all costs. Whatever moral compass they possess is a tertiary priority. Meanwhile if you or I get caught talking nonsense on a yahoo message-board, there's a very real possibility we go to jail.

**Mitigating Disparities of Access**

So, the game is rigged. We've always known that. But the average joe among us is finally getting a glimpse into just how that's achieved and that has the potential to empower us in ways that we've never before been empowered. If you don't know how you're getting fucked, you'll never see the dildo coming but if you know what to expect you can chop it off at the balls before it makes its way inside you... that's what my dad always told my anyways.

*Anything from this point forward are just my ideas about how we might address these disparities, but the key here is that we start having the discussions. If every idea I pose gets torn down because it's retarded (and I'm sure that they all are) I'll still consider it a win if it starts a discussion about how we as a collective can work our way out from under the might of this behemoth.*

I think it's time we start to completely re-imagine the way that small money invests and that we'd be best served by creating our own secondary market for securities that exists in parallel to, and completely independent from, the existing stock exchanges of the world. This secondary market should be entirely free of the influence of big money and serve as a platform for the transparent and honest trading of securities.

So how do we achieve these goals? Here's a list of guiding principles I've come up with:

- This marketplace should be open at all times, without closures or halts to the sale of any security.
- Member traders have access to all their assets at all times. 
- To ensure this, no person or collective should have access to assets on the exchange in the way a brokerage would; the exchange should exist as an infrastructure for the holding of assets in or movement of assets into, out of, and between one another. 
- Such a marketplace should seek to be as transparent as possible in every aspect, and allow for built-in avenues for both direct and community-wide communication between its member traders.
- To prevent the manipulation of this exchange, limits should exist for maximum allowable account size and maximum allowable assets to be transferred INTO but not out of an account. This allows an individual to make a hypothetically infinite amount of money, while disallowing the ability for any single actor to exert undue influence over the market.
- No liquidity should be required by the exchange itself. To achieve this end, trading should occur directly between individuals and no trading on margin should be allowed
- All accounts should be linked to existing brokerage/bank account(s) belonging to one person and validated against gov-issued ID. This prevents bad-faith actors from attempting to exert undue influence on the market by opening multiple accounts.
- All members’ profiles display a history of all trades completed by individual, but not current positions or transfers of assets in or out. This allows for a full log of market trends available to all traders without providing an excess of information that might give other individuals an advantage in trading.
- Stocks only; no short positions. Don't get me wrong, shorts have a purpose but the concept of borrowing shares and re-selling them later is antithetical to the idea of each account having in it only whatever assets that individual currently owns.
- All Intra-Market trades and trends should be visible to all member traders.

I hope you've enjoyed the musings of a hopeless retard. My ideas are probably garbage but they're garbage born of a desire to find a better way. Even if I haven't done that myself, I hope that we can do it together. Apes together strong. Have a good night.

 [S3 partners intentionally changed how they calculate SI % interest to manipulate public perception of shorts closing their positions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/) 

Pretty much the reason why S3 partners is estimating 55% short interest is because they changed the formula. It would be equivalent to what we would call 122% SI before the change (other people's math, not my own).

&#x200B;

They changed the formula from 

`SI = (shorts/float)`
to
`SI = (shorts/(float+shorts))`

This formula guarantees SI to always be beneath 100. 

Pretty much, 

0% is still 0%

50% is the new 100%

It doesn't scale up exactly linearly.

Do your DD, this is not financial advice, just thought I would bring this to light.

Be careful, do your research, not only is the game changing in front of us, but so are the standard measures.

Quick DD: Why S3 Partners' Short interest data is either BS or it is saying shorts doubled down,196,lbfzw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfzw6/quick_dd_why_s3_partners_short_interest_data_is/,31,1612356968,"Courtesy to u/smohyee for inspiration and picture

Last few days there has been this talk about shorts already covered, and S3 Partner's data showed a large decline in short interest. However, is this the full picture? We will be looking at this using Math. 

Context :[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

 """"it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted) """"

Basically, the S3 short interest is calculated as

f(x) = x/(k+x)

where f(x) is S3's short interest, x is shares shorted, and k is float, which we can assume is a constant

For the Math savvy autists, you probably already see the problem. If you are not, open Desmos and graph the above function.

For k been positive and real, This function **asymptotically approaches 1** i.e. 100%. It should be pretty obvious - shares shorted + something positive is larger than shares shorted, so the fraction is smaller than 1. And, surprise surprise, data before 1/29 have short interest higher than 1!

**That means that either S3 partners is completely bullshiting their data, or the more likely case -  short interest displayed before 1/29 is traditional interest.**

Looking at this tweet [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897), we can see that the traditional SI on 2/1 is **78.16MM** shares on **51.03MM** float, which equates to....drum roll please...

***153%*** ***Short interest!***

So not only have the shorts not squeezed, they have doubled down. And this explains the price action much better - the price dipped down on a **Increased selling**.

Who in their right mind would take massive losses and sell their shares when the price is, say, $5/share? Why not just hold and hope for a brighter day down the road? They have to keep the price above a reasonable level so that those shares wont be locked up.

Most of those 👨‍🚀🦍 who got in at <$30 are locked in on principal or are playing with the house's money. They aren't going to budge. The easiest people to shake will be those who bought in late. We are now below the $100 psychological level where paperhanded bitches will fold given enough time.

My guess is the play COULD be to seesaw from maybe $50 to $90 with occasional blips down into the 30s or lower to make it APPEAR as if the price is both settling and volatile enough to warrant a rapid descent. It could go on for days or weeks depending on what their books look like. That will scare a fuck ton of the bitches out of the game AND put the diamond handed retards in a position where they might actually consider selling.

So what's OUR play? As always: HOLD. This can only go on for so long. The shorts have to get covered. They are lying and manipulating to minimize losses but those who stay in the game will be rewarded IF we all call their bluff.

Wait, banks are massively short silver in the futures market?  Yes

Your title bashed silver though? Yes, it’s the only way to post about silver right now. Forgive me WSB gods.

You want me to sell GME and go into silver? No. Hold your GME and go to the moon if that’s your play.  While GME is the current religious level obsession of WSB, there are people who are still interested in other plays. We’re not your enemy, WSB used to be a place where people could pitch all kinds of trades and bulls and bears made fun of each other but didn’t try to ban one another. 

There is a lot of disinformation going around that somehow silver is being pushed to help the hedge funds and banks recover losses from GME or something, but that directly conflicts with their massive net short interest in the silver futures market.

Further, silver has gapped down several times over the past year and there was never a peep from regulators.  Over the weekend all physical silver bullion from retailers completely sold out and Monday saw silver massively gap up. That night the CFTC raised margin requirements and today silver plunged. 

When it’s speculative longs buying silver and banks shorting silver, it’s the longs who were forced to sell today when margin requirements were raised.  Banks have essentially unlimited liquidity so a margin raise doesn’t affect them like it does speculators who are individuals.  

This is why for the short squeeze to work we need futures traders who won’t use their margin to max out long positions. Drastically cut back your leverage or don’t use it at all. Hold the cash you need to actually buy the silver at expiration, and then take physical delivery.  The shorts won’t be able to get enough silver to satisfy the contracts and will be left scrambling and silver prices absolutely soaring.

The silver short squeeze is an entirely different animal than GME, but it’s pretty obvious from the public data on net positioning by banks, and the immediate regulator action to the surge in price, that this is another case of retail vs corrupt wall st. banks.  

Silver surfers are fighting the same battle you are but in a different market and with bigger opponents.

FISV WILL DOUBLE BEFORE EOY,3,lbfw9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfw9l/fisv_will_double_before_eoy/,30,1612356602,"Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it’s only gonna get better as it has for me. Here’s a little of my own DD.

There is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:
Point of sales (POS) terminals
Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments
E-commerce solutions
  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.
A leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL’s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that’s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. 

As I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square’s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. 

The difference between Zelle and PYPL’s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn’t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved
in Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it’s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader.

Post $GME and $AMC - Next Potential Short Squeeze Target ($TLRY),0,lbftmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbftmg/post_gme_and_amc_next_potential_short_squeeze/,75,1612356334,"For those of you still holding $GME and $AMC, Congratulations! Over the past week you've been bombarded with numerous challenges, from brokers restricting purchases, fake news, to stock dilution. It is always harder to hold a winning position than a losing one so my hats off to you sir if you are still holding.

With that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a next potential candidate for our short squeeze strategy. The company is Tilray ($TLRY). You've probably seen this symbol floating around in different posts but I'd like to talk to you specifically about the numbers and the timing of it.

If you've been living under a rock or on a tree (You ape) Tilray is a Canadian Cannabis company with its stock traded on the Nasdaq (Not a lot of legal Cannabis companies are traded on the regulated exchanges so this is a big thing). Aphria ($APHA) is in the process of acquiring Tilray and post-acquisition will become the largest Cannabis company in the world. The deal is expected to close sometime during the second quarter and $APHA will be taking over the Tilray name and the $TLRY symbol on the Nasdaq.

As per Yahoo Finance, the latest float is about 95 Million shares and even though the current shares sold short (From Jan 15, 2021) is 34.37 Million which is moderate, one should pay attention to the historical total shares sold short which from a month ago has grown more than 24%. This means there is something in play and I am also willing to bet based on current price action and historical trends, the next short interest release will go up as well.

&#x200B;

[Large Rise in Total Shares Sold Short](https://preview.redd.it/pemqywhf07f61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=813869b0195bc158c342de184f9a9dae2d3d598f)

Based on the amount of money involved there is probably one large or multiple large hedge funds playing this since they are the only ones sophisticated enough to sell shares short especially involving that much money. You can also look at the price action itself prior to Monday (When Good news got released) during different times of the day, there are always trades put in near the closing to make sure the prices don't exceed a certain price level which indicates true active manipulation by the bears. Retail traders are not sophisticated enough to do this thus indicating large hedge fund involvement.

There are a couple of factors that will help us with this conquest.

1. The Timing and News: Obviously, with this democratically controlled congress, legalization is a priority and has the highest chances of succeeding in this current political environment. As you have seen before (Do your own DD), any indication or news of progress of legalization has pushed this stock up. As of Monday, three senators; Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Brooker (NJ), and Ron Wyden (OR) just promised to introduce marijuana legalization reform in the ""early part"" of the year. So there is a string of news and progress coming.
2. Way better fundamentals than $GME and $AMC: The poor fundamentals obviously bothered a lot of people who wanted to buy $GME and $AMC. But in comparison, if you dig into Tilray's financials, it is significantly better. Especially the cash balance. Mostly importantly, Tilray's product lines are diversified and they are currently still growing (this is a big thing for any business), especially in the international markets.
3. Its already primed: If you dig around Reddit, WSB, or even Stocktwits, you can see numerous people have already committed to baggage holding this stock. You are not too early and you won't be the only one to do so.
4. Harder for Management to Dilute the shares: As we saw previously, one of the challenges for the buyers of $GME and $AMC was battling against management's decision of stock dilution by the companies themselves. To put it in retard terms, diluting a stock is essentially printing more shares thus creating inflation in the stock so its harder to go up. Since Tilray is in the process of the acquisition by Aphria and it is an ALL STOCK deal via conversion ratio, it makes it harder for Tilray to implement dilution without significantly risking the deal.
5. Lightning can strike twice: A short-squeeze already happened in the past (2018) so you know the short-squeeze strategy already worked for this stock so it can work again. The brokers and exchanges are more prepared as their volatility risk models are already prepared to support significant high levels of volatility for this stock. Less chance for disruptions.
6. A means to an end: Lets be realistic, if you are holding $GME and $AMC right now, you will sell it. It could be tomorrow or it could be 3 years from now (If those companies are still in business) but you WILL sell it.  THAT is a very long time to hold baggage just to prove a point and you know the businesses you are holding suck from a business standpoint. Now since the Tilray and Aphia acquisition deal is on a timetable which will be completed sometime in the second quarter, that can be your exit time. You can go out gracefully if you choose to as you've already proven your point, made some money, and on the dawn of Tilray becoming a different company and under new management. For those of you choosing to keep those those shares post acquisition, how would you feel about holding shares to the largest Cannabis company in the world with good fundamentals, and on the dawn of full federal marijuana legalization? I would love it.
7. Great Symbolism: Lets face it, investing in a failing gaming company and movie theaters during a global pandemic doesn't really scream smart symbolic reform or via la revolution that well. But if you choose to focus on making a stand with a legal Cannabis company with a great future you can at the same time promote marijuana legalization and stick it to the hedge funds and dark capitalism at the same time. What better way to make a point to promote a great cause, symbiotic change, and at the same time make some money (If we are all on board).

Ok that's it! Kudos to you for making it to the end. Apologies for the long post but I really wanted to  get my points through. You all should obviously do your own due diligence and if you see what I see and the immense opportunity that is in front of us, and agree with my thoughts then lets do this!

BTW, if you are really retarded; I am NOT telling you to sell your $GME and $AMC. I'm only suggesting that we should start to look at other potential candidates for our short squeeze strategy to continue our cause of burning hedge funds and dark capitalism.

I just feel Tilray is such a great candidate for our cause and strategy especially with so much marijuana reform coming our way. We can make a greater point for a greater cause.

Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.  
It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.  


Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom. 

To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.

  
Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:

\- a boogeyman  
\- something blocking the goddamn exit  


The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.   
It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.  


THEN, we come.  
We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.

What are we? We are bodies.  
Pilling up.  
On the fucking exits.

The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.  


Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes.If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.

Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.

That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available.If say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot.Heck, even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.  


Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.

We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb.THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE.HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.  


We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.  


&#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype dies.We need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.**

Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.

1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue).
2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter).

DO NOT BUY CALLS IN MARGIN ACCOUNT !!!,151,lbfhhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfhhd/do_not_buy_calls_in_margin_account/,19,1612355178,"It's obvious that stocks like GME and AMC are prime targets for short sellers who want to bring the price down.

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' ""lendable shares"" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

NOK Stock go Brrrr 🚀,200,lbfh6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfh6f/nok_stock_go_brrrr/,50,1612355147,"Here’s why NOK stock is an undervalued long:

So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)

Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norway’s leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to €4.80, or for those of us who speak freedom, $5.80.

Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because it’s currently trading at only $4.53. 

There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people. I’m buying more tomorrow, see y’all in space.

TLDR: worst case I make $1 per share as it goes up back to its evaluated price, or I💎🤲 until it hits $10 a share as it’s 5G grows in the coming years.

This was NIO’s 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and they’ve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit? *YOU should.* 💦😩

NIO is *only up 5%* over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants **25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025**. NIO’s continual market share growth into *the* largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with China’s EV sales [expected to top 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-catalyst-could-move-chinese-213553234.html). It has almost completely retraced it’s price back to it’s pre-NIO Day levels, suggesting that it’s ready for a breakout. No, literally [go look at it’s chart right now.](https://imgur.com/a/dtPsHVb)

&#x200B;

In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to **expand into Europe** with it’s SUVs. *THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS* They’ve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China. It also goes without saying that having active backup from your authoritarian country is VERY helpful.

GME: Looking at Some Data!,369,lc1m7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc1m7d/gme_looking_at_some_data/,52,1612423999,"Let's look at some charts again and try to figure out what went on today. Before that, I just want to make sure people understand that I'm just looking at some data and \*guessing\* what is happening. I do that mainly for myself because I don't fully trust anyone's judgment and I want to be in charge of my decisions. I could be wrong! I think you should do to same: try to gather as much information as possible, process that information, and make up your mind! If you lose money this way (instead of following people blindly), at least you learn from your mistakes.

Let's jump into it: Based on the position-cost distribution from today (from Webull), I see that [yesterday's pattern](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc5gq/gmes_data_irregularities/) happened again: there was a decent amount of shares added to the float, take a look:

[Position Cost Distribution Comparison: 2\/2 vs 2\/3](https://i.redd.it/xdl3jjnbfcf61.gif)

Today's change, however, is slightly different: as you can see, it looks like a relatively small amount of shares went from below $92 to above it. This could be due to either some profit-taking, day-trading, or scalping.  Note that stock price went up but ""Total Profited Shares Proportion"" is slightly down because of both of these (short selling as soon as price went up, and some profit-taking/day trading/scalping). I personally think that the bigger pattern is the new shares that seem to be added to the float and there has been a lot of short selling activity in the past two days:

[2\/1 vs 2\/2 vs 2\/3](https://i.redd.it/4ohs95ingcf61.gif)

Where are they getting these shares from? I have no idea!

Another thing that keeps happening (I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laqa34/gme_evidence_of_short_seller_collusion_for_months/) the first time I noticed) is that I see a lot (what looks to be fake) orders with weird numbers. I don't know what these are (they don't look real, but I also doubt that they are just a glitch) and my previous guess (explained in a previous post) was probably wrong because today I saw this:

[Weird orders with very high SP](https://preview.redd.it/spb6cfqrhcf61.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9d5c101eb9b9d6d83cd9e3926dc540cc02bf1bb)

As well as this:

[Weird orders with very low SP](https://preview.redd.it/8t4jav0gicf61.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=041863b257100cba3c0aa3d271ebaccd270f8250)

So if anyone has a plausible explanation for these weird orders, please let me know!

PS. There are massive open interests on both put and call options that expire this Friday, so things might get extremely volatile again!

US Marijuana Legalization: the next rocket catalyst,164,lc1g07,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc1g07/us_marijuana_legalization_the_next_rocket_catalyst/,109,1612423486,"**Bubbles**
An emergence of a new industry usually results in a bubble due to the necessity of making a lot of assumptions about future growth to value a stock since there is no historical precedent. The enthusiasm for a paradigm shift causes investors to frequently overshoot and result in what may be quite astronomical valuations. Currently, the US equities market is quite frothy with unprecedented loose monetary policy causing an asset bubble of historic proportions. Jeremy Graham calls the US equities the biggest bubble he has ever seen in his investing career.  With the Democrats in charge of government, the corresponding stimulus bill will result in a melt up of the stock market along with risky equities. 

**Government Involvement** 
Government policy and actions can ignite a bubble. Chinese EV stocks were in the dumps during March 2020 due to the Covid shut downs, and the curtailment by the Chinese government of EV subsidies. NIO was on the verge of bankruptcy with only having enough cash to sustain its payrolls for 2 months at the time. But the subsequent 180 from the government for EV subsidies along with a partnership with a local government entity caused NIO to skyrocket. 

We are already in an environment of risk seeking, frothy environment where a value play of a struggling retailer can turn into a short squeeze that ends up as a social moment. This is a crazy market, and it will get even crazier when Congress legalizes marijuana.

US marijuana legalization efforts has followed a similar path to gay marriage where the public opinion over the decade has shifted due to states leading the way for legalization followed by an increasingly favorable depiction in popular culture that has shifted public opinion. I believe we are on the verge of legalization now that the Democrats hold all positions of power in government, and they are willing to pass progressive policies after getting stung in the Obama administration for trying to negotiate a “bipartisan” path that went nowhere.  

**Political Calculus**
The House has already passed HR 3884 MORE Act of 2020 that pretty much legalized marijuana. Schumer who is the current Senate Majority Leader, sponsored the S 1552 Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act in 2019, but it went nowhere since McConnell ran the show at the time. Legal marijuana is Schumer’s pet legislation he has been pushing for years, and he is under pressure to enact progressive legislation due to threats of other progressives running against him in the 2022 primary. He will most likely push to get it passed in the Senate before his primary so that he can parade it in his re-election campaign and kill any progressive challenges to his seat. 

Marijuana stocks have done well since the election, but I think they have more room to go due to the following reasons. Once legalization happens, a couple of things happen. 

1.    **Institutional money.** US banks and institutional investors cannot invest in a company that produces a product that is federally illegal. However, once legalization happens, the barrier no longer applies. You will have a flood of institutional funds buying up companies operating in a grey zone (hence my preference for US based MSOs compared to more mainstream Canadian companies). 

2.	**Taxes.** Currently, IRS does not allow medical marijuana companies to deduct their business expenses so most of them are operating at a loss despite 50-70% gross margin. Once marijuana is legalized, their tax bill will no longer cause them to operate at a loss. 

3.	**Availability.** US MSO who have the biggest to gain from this are trading in Canadian stock exchanges in a quasi-grey area. Once they become legalized, they can move into main stream stock exchanges like NYSE which can open them up to retail investors to trade in. 

4.	**Financing.** The best US MSO can only get a 10% rate for their financing needs in order to expand due to the lack of banks willing to do business with them because of the ambiguity in the federal guidelines. When the restriction is lifted, their financing costs will go down and their payment processing fees/ availability will improve.

Don't trade on margin if you want to have diamond hands,165,lc15r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc15r6/dont_trade_on_margin_if_you_want_to_have_diamond/,12,1612422687,"Margin is alluring because it gives you control of money you do not have. But keep in mind that you are borrowing money from your broker with interest, and the broker will liquidate your position if you fall below a threshold, e.g., 33%, 50%, etc., depending on your broker. If you are margin called, some brokers will call you and give you time to add additional funds (which you may not have) or liquidate your positions before they are force liquidated. However, if you look into the contractual language between you and your broker, they are NOT obligated to give you a heads up. Moreover, given that they are likely bombarded right now, and probably have an incentive to liquidate your positions, they are mostly likely allowed to manually liquidate your position, e.g., your GME long positions. You cannot diamond hand a position that is manually liquidated by your broker. 

Some of you may say that you cant even go on margin on GME. That is true for some brokers. If you want to trade GME, don't go on margin trying to trade any other equity. Do not give your broker a chance to liquidate your positions.

I will highlight why I think BlackBerry is in the middle of an acquisition, I will provide facts but also my own opinion. So please do your own DD, and make your own thoughts about it.   


**39m shares** have been bought/sold in blocks since the 28th of December. I have no way to see if these are only buys or also sells. These block trades have happened no matter the SP. The biggest block was over $70m. (Can someone confirm if this is buy orders?)   
Source: [https://stocktwits.com/search/u/TradeWithAlerts?symbol=BB](https://stocktwits.com/search/u/TradeWithAlerts?symbol=BB) 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, there's a lot of options activity going on 19th of Feb. These options are unrealistic without anything huge should happen. The biggest one was a $500k $38 call strikes for the 19th of Feb. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o87wxv3nccf61.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=384db3117e1d72c44d40642e735d7008a833559d

If you compare these with the week before or the week after you will see that there's A LOT more call option activity for the 19th of Feb.   


**More evidence:** 

https://preview.redd.it/pab43ie2dcf61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e36228cdee1fa6d600fa22fb81ad5756aaf97f

John Chen will get a big bonus if the stock hits $30. This correlates perfectly with the relative high call options activity above $30. 

What about other events that could trigger a high amount of call options? We have the Facebook settlement. But that still doesn't explain the big block trades. 

https://preview.redd.it/tevv25p3ecf61.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=29cfd2bfbf7b75e892e7fb0711f8c7d6fa829d4c

The institutional ownership has also increased from around 49% last month to almost 66%.   


Who could be the buyer you might ask? Well since Amazon and BlackBerry have a pretty huge partnership, I would assume they could be the buyer.   


https://preview.redd.it/ci2qrjw0fcf61.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=056d9e0f4666f95409fac863087f569c5e07a009

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** If BlackBerry were to be acquired I would think the offer would be around $35-50 a share. I would think this could happen before the 19th of Feb, because of the call options activity. Imagine if they actually are in an Acquisition and /WSB just made them pay a huge premium cuz of the pump? GG's

$BB went up today. Is that good for $BB investors & bagholders? Yes, you grunt, drooling onto your weighted blanket. But axchuaallly…..shit I don’t know I’m just a retard but I think the answer is sort of, only maybe. 

I updated my chart from yesterday. As we in the $BB gang already know, $BB's a [steady eddy space shuttle headed to mar](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/)s. If you even look @ the price anymore you're a puss looking at prices are for paper hands. 

But look at this fucking thing.

[Live by $BANG, Die by $BANG](https://preview.redd.it/qyd7aorh8cf61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffa10ba469718f6939f3eb9f85288d3ead95bae)

**Look at the correlation.** For the smooth brains – you might think yeah no shit those are the most common tickers on reddit so what. 

So WHatt??? This is a weird thing!!!! **There is no** ***fundamental*** **(yes many of you don't have that word in your vocab idc bite me) reason** for these stocks to trade tegoether. *Why the fuck would an Endpoint security company, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider trade in tandem other than just being meme stocks?* 

Re: the downwards movement, my hypothesis was [degrossing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)  / [margin calls on retail account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/)s - $BANG was the most commonly held basket in RobinHood accounts this past few weeks and dips get exacerbated by margin calls .

But….....what goes down must also go up. Said another way – What’s causing correlation on the upswings as well? **Why would buyers of $BB today also be buying a*****, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider****,* especially after the loss porn of the past few days? **And especially since the front page has been dominated almost entirely by $GME / $AMC ?** 

*BTW the reason some of the $BB GANG want a conscious decoupling (it's not you...it's us) from the memes (fuck the memes) is so that people can realize the true fundamental value of Papa Chen’s Cyber Co. vs. the continual austistic screeching about Janet Yellin and Melvin (newsflash Melvin got the fuck out already)*

Anyways – So the question is sure, initially some retards bought the whole $BANG before $GME blasted off, but why is that still holding true? My theory, having a number of acquaintances @ hedge funds (no none of them Melvin fuck you)  is - yesit’s WSB’s favoriate bogeyman - those very same hedge funds. 

As [Chamath so eloquently described](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html) as he verbally tore CNBC a new asshoe, hedgies may wear infinitely finer suits and sport cleaner underwear but they chase the very same tendies. The dirty little scecret is a big part of what they do is **momentum chasing** – Buying what goes up and selling what goes down. 

Those initial shackles binding $BANG were the idiots here (including me) who bought $BANG in various combinations. But now those shackles are wrapped in **$BILLIONS$** of load-bearing momentum strategies. Long shorts funds. Market neutral funds. And, perhaps ***most hilariously***, the [black box quant strategies](https://www.ft.com/content/81811f27-4a8f-4941-99b3-2762cae76542) with Harvard PhD-designed models that probably – accidentally - now have a meme basket that they trade, punting on shares of $BB, $NOK, $AMC, and $GME like the most retarded amongst us. 

# TLDR – I LIKE $BB MID AND LONG TERM, AND EVENTUALLY IT NEEDS TO DECOUPLE FROM $BANG TO ACHIEVE TRUE GREATNESS. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM I AM PRAYING TO CHEETO JESUS FOR YOU $GME / $AMC /$NOK BROTHERS – FOR BETTER OR WORSE WE'RE ALL BONDED TIGHER THAN [VLAD'S CLENCHED BUTTHOLE.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184)

*PS If I were less of a retard I might try to design an option spread to take advantage of the (1) $BANG correlation and (2) the fact that $BB and $NOK swings are more muted. There’s $$$ to be made there I think some of you smart options monkeys figure that one out. Other interesting ways to make $$$* *- Betting on what tickers (Tootsie roll gang anyone? Fuck that one lost me a lot of $$) become meme stocks and drop out of being a meme stock*

*Disclaimer I'm balls deep in $BB and am a retard who just likes the stock do your own research*",04-02-2021 08:50,60,4969,negative,-0.296,negative

Now is the time,161,lc0gd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc0gd5/now_is_the_time/,35,1612420792,"Listen up fellow 🦍.

Now is the time to buy and here’s why. Since Jan 26th this hasn’t been about investing. It’s been about trading. It’s a simple supply and demand. We took the supply and they have a demand.

Some questionably legal practices have left us wondering about the reality of the situation. 

But today’s $GME news changed some things. Our favorite business is changing focus to e-commerce and new senior management appointees spell a new direction.

Since several of the big name appointees come from Chewy, it’s reasonable to draw comparison between businesses. It also makes sense based on probable business model. 

$CHEWY closed today at $103.71 and is considered a solid buy with room to grow. It’s mostly online and delivers pet food to your front door. The average cost of dog food is $500 per year per dog. There are 63.4 million dog owners in the US. 
63.4 million ppl x 1.5 avg dogs x $500 = $47.5B

$GME closed today at $92.41 and is starting transition to mostly online and delivering games to your front door or straight to your PC. The average gamer spends $217.64 per year. There are 200 million gamers in America (including mobile games - so granny playing candy crush counts).
200 million ppl x $217.64 = $43.5B

Plus, GME just got global attention. They already have stores in Europe, Australia, and NZ.  Shipping an 8oz video game case or a delivering a digital license around the world is a easier than shipping physical bags of dog food from the US. 

At the current price, anything below $100 of GME is now a viable long term investment over several years. If GME achieves Chewy levels of  success in e-commerce those sub $100 shares are right back on par with average investments. Plus there’s still the upside of forming a squeeze.

This should be right about the bottom. The 🧻🤲🏽 losers who hoped on the hype-train late have fled. The wise money should be buying back in. Calls are dirt cheap too. 

💎💎🤲🏽🤲🏽 forever.

Earnings for the week Start 2/1 with Short Squeeze Potential (Mid-Week Update),41,lc09s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc09s5/earnings_for_the_week_start_21_with_short_squeeze/,6,1612420312,"Good evening everyone,

&#x200B;

As some of you may have seen, on Sunday night I posted a chart for earnings this week (2/1) with somewhat higher short squeeze potential. I have decided to provide a mid-week update. To do this, I took the most recent closing price and subtracted it from the next closing price. So if a company reported earnings in the morning, I took the closing price from the day before, and the closing price from the day the earnings was reported, and converted into a daily change (which will be shown in the chart as well). With out further delay, here are the current results:

Date|Ticker|% Short|DTC|Beat EPS|Beat rev|% Change
 -----|-----|-----|-----|---------|---------|--------- 
2/1|ON|8.49|4.302096178|Yes|Yes|6.34%

2/3|CHKP|7.76|6.668711656|yes|yes|-10.48%
2/3|TTMI|12.62|12.03571429|Yes|Yes|**2.71%
2/3|GRUB|15.58|12.24576271|No|No|**-4.40%

** These two are too early to tell the official outcome, but as of the time of writing both had reported earnings, and that was their current price change.

For the remainder of the week, your earnings calendar looks like this:

Date|Ticker|% Short|DTC
-----|-----|-----|-----
2/4|NYT|10.91|5.51
2/4|VSTO|7.74|3.82
2/4|PTEN|10.85|7.26

2/4|WWE|8.9|3.87
2/4|ZEN|7.12|5.84
2/5|AON|9.87|15.04

I will aim to post the calendar for this upcoming week on Sunday, around 1 EST.

Anyone playing TSMC meeting tomorrow?,26,lbzzie,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbzzie/anyone_playing_tsmc_meeting_tomorrow/,23,1612419537,"I found [this](https://technosports.co.in/2021/01/30/the-u-s-administration-calls-a-meeting-with-taiwanese-chipmakers-to-discuss-the-chip-crisis/) link the other day and really haven’t seen much news otherwise than the fact we are having a chip [shortage](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/tsmc-says-expediting-auto-products-005621030.html).

Apparently the administration is having a meeting with TSM to pressure them to increase their supply.  With the Democrats positive view towards Taiwan I’m hoping there is some positive buzz.

Tony hawk just did his last 720 a week ago. Hes also in AMC. The celeberttiiries, actors, actresses, stages crews, writers, editors, cast, crews, sound effects, what do they all have in common. the mother fucking movies. thats right. well im a dumbass what does that mean. it means this is the beginning of the show of support from these people that count on theatres being open as their fucking career depends on it. Yeah I might not ever be in the same room as jennifer lawson or leonardo dicaprio. but when youre at the fucking theatre you are. people are sick of sitting at home from covid netflixing the office and jacking off.  They want to go out and get handies in a large bucket of butttery popcorn like the old times maybe hit a homerun in the back of your buddies car in the amc parking lot.

ima sit back and wait for other closeted celebs to come out and show their support for amc. but wait media might not let them cause they got their balls in a vice grip.

Therefore any shady trading activity would be publicly viewable, and no-one could control access to trading itself.

A Stock Market by the people, for the people.

$TAKOF - Drone Delivery Canada DD,47,lbzt8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbzt8u/takof_drone_delivery_canada_dd/,29,1612419061," tl;dr: $*TAKOF* is taking off and going places. Rockets (or batteries) have been fueled – up we go! I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

(**Sources in comments**)

Longer version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, green revolution, retail industry tendencies). Today I’ll share my opinion about future of deliveries.

For quite a while there has been a buzz around drone deliveries. Be it Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward, DHL Parcelcopter (my favorite because of this ridiculous name), Boeing’s Matternet… Everyone with the capacity to is trying to jump on this ship. You can read more about latest developments and companies working in Source 1.

Why there’s such race to develop unmanned cargo air vehicles and autonomous flight technology you might ask? Well, drone doesn’t get sick, can workday and night, it doesn’t have to take breaks or spend half of it’s time chatting around or staring at its phone. It also doesn’t need any contributions to its pension fund or healthcare insurance (needs insurance nevertheless, but technical insurances should come at much better rate than insuring a ball of flesh against all that world could throw at it). Finally, drones don’t care if there’s pandemic raging outside or boogaloo boys are stepping on the grass around some government building.

Drone comes off for the buyer as a one-time purchase cost, thus saving loads of cash in the lung run. Many businesses are taking more ‘green’ approach to their business and calculate their CO2 footprint. Given that drones are powered by electricity (all the attention to the renewable energy, wink wink) it would also help business to boast about reducing carbon footprint while improving their efficiency.

One might think of one issue here: drones are cool and stuff, but what about the battery - it might not be able to cover required distance? Worry not, there are already solutions for this. Mainly ultra-fast charging stations (charge time: 5 minutes) or wireless charging hotspots (charge time: 6 minutes). Check out Source 2 and Source 3.

All in all I believe that drones have a bright future ahead of them and $*TAKOF* is one of the players in this industry.

**Company**: Founded in 2014, Drone Delivery Canada has developed a proprietary and patented turnkey drone delivery solution. The company is fully commercialized, operational, and revenue generating.

DDC has developed a drone delivery platform solution which is cost effective, highly scalable and can provide next generation logistic services to various market sectors including: retail, ecommerce, parcel & post, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil & gas, logistics companies, Indigenous Communities, military and government agencies, in Canada and internationally. The Company’s patented, fully integrated hardware/software platform is used as a managed service in a SaaS business model. Drone Delivery Canada is fully commercialized, operational and revenue-generating, with a robust sales funnel of global prospects. [https://dronedeliverycanada.com](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/)

So far, the company has signed test flight agreements with several major corporations. A medical facility in Ontario, two remote First Nations communities in the same province, GlobalMedic, and Air Canada have all agreed to test the company’s drones. Last year, it also struck a partnership with European logistics/transport group DSV Panalpina A/S.

**Latest Catalysts**: Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX® Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts**: release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market – at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst**: establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7 – claims $*TAKOF* has multi-bagger also discusses $*TAKOF* cash position).

[Source 8](https://preview.redd.it/at9xb9uf6cf61.jpg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb0a0b32b6dba11ac4e1c7ccfd7060ef2ff95c5)

**Summary**: $*TAKOF* is ready for a take off! It’s literally in their name. 3 rockets.

Seriously, given all the craziness in the current market I wouldn’t rule out this reaching $10 in the next months. Especially if expansion to US is confirmed.

The Real Value Behind GME (In-Depth DD),133,lc9053,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc9053/the_real_value_behind_gme_indepth_dd/,28,1612446961,"LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons).

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough.

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward.

Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle.

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth.

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop.

Most recently were the adds today. Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.

Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock.

But what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions about $300k in GME and another $250k more in cash waiting for a drop if it happens.

Do you see the two mountain peaks? Good. Now we pivot over to the Himalayas. You can see Changste and Nirekha, just below Everest. We haven’t even started that final ascent yet. And we’re climbing without oxygen tanks.

Next. Say it out loud. GME -> GHB. Yup that one. Melvin. Citadel. RH. Who knows who else be slipping it in our drink. But we ain’t bending over. We need to remember everything. Everything they’ve done to keep us down. And they ain’t off our back yet. 

Volume. 42.7m today. 60 day avg 23.89m. Almost double. Why’s the volume so high? This is a party. People like to listen to loud music. That’s an insanely high number of decibels. Put in your plugs (at least 2 but more is recommended). Tinnitus is not great.

Fundamentals. 69m shares outstanding. Yup. It’s one of those parties. 6.28b cap full of GHB. Walk up to a stranger baby like can I suck your tongue? 121% float snorted. 2,000% high and can’t even see the ground.

It lit. Everyone want in. Rumors flying. Dirty tricks everywhere. Snakes trying to lure us away and swallow us whole. Pigs trying to blow this house down. Don’t forget though. This is a movement.

The following is entirely a work of fiction created by a retarded and autistic monkey who was left to pound away on a keyboard for a few hours. This monkey is neither a lawyer nor a financial advisor, and the following is not to be construed as financial or legal advice. 

I will start first by saying: I’m new here, but the shit I’ve seen the past few weeks has been mind blowing. Honestly, I was annoyed at first that people were trying to co-opt this into a direct battle with the HFs, and later into some kind of class warfare instead of just an educated bet that might let us snag a few juicy tendies from some fuckwits who shoved their hands way too far into a tiny cookie jar.

&#x200B;

**1.Past Posts and A Few Nitty-Gritty Additions**

Many of you have seen the DD done by u/johnnydaggers   [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) (you STILL okay bro?), as well as the information on this website: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (If you haven’t read this yet fucking do it right now, and read the whole thing.)

Now...I’m a skeptical as fuck autist. I don’t just believe anything at a glance, and a lot of the information contained in the white paper “Counterfeiting Stock 2.0” doesn’t contain many links to the cited supporting documents or specific references...and that troubles the autist half of my brain. So I decided to at least spot check and zoom in on a detail that caught my eye. 

&#x200B;

**ZOOM-- ENHANCE!**

(See: Counterfeiting a Stock 2.0 - Part 6-  Why does this continue to happen?)

* Both houses of the Utah legislature passed a bill that required daily disclosure of fails–to–deliver, including identifying specific companies and the specific broker dealer positions in that company. The bill also outlawed naked shorting of companies domiciled in Utah. The industry threatened litigation based upon federal preemption and backed the state down. The bill was not signed into law.
* In February 2007 the SEC determined that the hedge fund industry did not require any additional regulation — they are virtually unregulated. This may be the height of arrogance.

I searched for the specific bill the author mentioned in Utah. (For those of you who don’t know, you can look up all laws proposed and passed at the local, state, and federal level. They document all of this shit.) Well, I found it and read enough of it to satisfy my semi autistic brain:

[https://le.utah.gov/\~2006S3/bills/sbillenr/SB3004.htm](https://le.utah.gov/~2006S3/bills/sbillenr/SB3004.htm) 

For those of you who are less autistic than I am, here are the most important parts:

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Narrowing of window to deliver securities to 24 hours as well as provide detailed information about the transaction:**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SUBSTANTIAL Penalties imposed on ALL parties responsible for a failure to deliver.**

Here’s what the authors of the white paper got wrong though, the bill passed almost unanimously and WAS signed into law ([https://le.utah.gov/\~2006s3/status/sbillsta/SB3004.htm](https://le.utah.gov/~2006s3/status/sbillsta/SB3004.htm)). However, it was repealed later. Again, with an overwhelming vote: [https://www.investmentnews.com/utah-votes-to-repeal-fail-to-deliver-law-7720](https://www.investmentnews.com/utah-votes-to-repeal-fail-to-deliver-law-7720) 

It seems they were bullied into doing this by SEC and SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). This is the first time I’ve heard of this player in the game. They are an advocacy group supporting the rights of the securities industry (lol). They are staffed mostly by big players in the banking and securities industry. They are a “non-profit” with a CEO who is compensated almost $3 million/year. This number is from the CEO in 2012, I can’t for the life of me find any info on salaries after that date so I can only assume that it’s higher now. (info from: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities\_Industry\_and\_Financial\_Markets\_Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Industry_and_Financial_Markets_Association).)

Look at all of the cool things they are doing: [https://www.sifma.org/resources/archive/news/](https://www.sifma.org/resources/archive/news/) 

&#x200B;

**2.Back to the Self-Incriminating SEC doc**

If you haven’t yet, look at this report below, read the first 3-5 pages at least. It’s an executive summary, published BY SEC, about counterfeiting shares and the roll it played in the financial crisis of 2006-2008. 

[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf) 

THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. FUCKING READ THAT REPORT YOU FUCKING RETARDED AUTISTS. IT’S PUBLISHED BY THE SEC AND SUGGESTS THAT WE MIGHT BE BUYING COUNTERFEIT SHARES THAT ARE BEING CONJURED INTO EXISTENCE RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES. 

OUR STRATEGY TO BUY AND HOLD IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING WE CAN DO, BUT WE MIGHT BE PUTTING SOME MONEY BACK IN THOSE FUCKERS POCKETS FOR THEM TO RELOAD. WE (retail investors) MIGHT OWN MORE SHARES THAN ARE EVEN SUPPOSED TO EXIST, NOT COUNTING WHAT OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER SHAREHOLDERS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.   


FUCKING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

&#x200B;

**3.What does this mean??**

If this is true, and as pervasive in the system as all of this shit suggests. They could be stealing billions, if not fucking TRILLIONS of dollars every year, at everyone else’s expense. When I say everyone, I mean fucking EVERYONE, the entire world economy revolves around the US market. The fraud here creates excess capital in the system that isn’t backed by any real securities, i.e. inflation. Your money is worth less when these fucks start counterfeiting shares.

&#x200B;

Explanation in retarded ape terms:

Let’s say you and your friends have 10 **🍌**. You each paid one **🍗** (tendie) for each **🍌**. Each **🍌** is still worth 1 **🍗** and you can trade it in at any time. (We’ll assume that the value stays constant, doesn’t really matter if the price goes up and down for this example as it obviously would in the stock market). But uh oh! Here comes a **🐍**. He made 5 fake plastic **🍌** and he decides to sell them to you retarded apes. You each pay him about one tendie for each fake **🍌**. Now there is a larger supply of **🍌** than there should be! Let’s say in total that it cost you all 14 **🍗** for all 15 **🍌** (due to the reduction in price caused by the surplus **🍌** in the system). Mr. **🐍** slithers off with 4 **🍗**!!! You and your friends now have 10 real **🍌**, 5 fake **🍌**, and you paid 14 whole **🍗** for them! Silly retarded apes. Oh, and since you and your dumb fuck friends can’t count at all, and/or lose count every 3 days, you have no fucking idea how many total **🍌** there are!

&#x200B;

**4.What Else Can We Do Besides Staring At Tickers and Scrolling Through Memes?**

So what do we do? Well...I think the place to go now is to raise as much hell as we possibly can while we continue to **💎🖐️🖐️💎**. We shouldn't just sit around waiting for the Robinhood hearing. Fucking Feb. 18th?? My thought is that Robinhood might just end up being the fall guy; mostly a distraction from all of the other shit going on. It may have even been legitimately out of RH’s control to some extent. Vlad claimed that their clearing house suddenly demanded $3 billion more from them in collateral, leaving them scrambling. Meanwhile, the HFs are still up to their dirty tricks. 

ALL of the responsible parties need to be investigated and held accountable. This could even include the NYSE itself, DTCC (for either clearing fraudulent transactions or failing to resolve the FTDs), Citadel, Melvin Capital, and SEC. Hopefully this would be done by a committee completely independent from SEC, maybe it would even be the DOJ. If the “counterfeit stock” theory is true, and actually, even if it is just good ol’ fashioned market manipulation, then all of them, at every level are complicit in this. This isn’t an isolated case as others have pointed out.They are all trying to cover their asses here to “protect the integrity of the entire marketplace and the interests of investors.” Translation: fuck with it however they want, in whatever way benefits them and maintain the status quo.

&#x200B;

**CONTACT LEGISLATORS AND FILE COMPLAINTS WITH EVERYONE**

**Specific Entities to Contact or File Complaints With:**

File complaints with: 

* NYSE: [https://www.nyse.com/contact](https://www.nyse.com/contact) 
* SEC (for a paper trail if nothing else): [https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Contact your state governments. Senators, and congressmen/women!! There were more than a few states that tried to close the loopholes which allow the market manipulation we are currently witnessing.

Fucking REEEEEE at the top of your lungs, fellow retards and autists! We need to let them know what we need and *expect* from them.

To our 💎🖐️🖐️💎 friends in every part of the world: we need your help too! I believe many countries in Europe (and countries throughout the world) have systems in place which make FTDs impossible. Trades are completed instantly between parties so a security HAS to be delivered (their systems aren’t archaic, retarded, and easily exploited like ours). Join us in raising hell because this directly impacts you too. Your governments and the market infrastructures you have in place may give valuable data if we can get it. Contact your local governments and regulating bodies!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

\- First of all, fuck you, that monkey spent a few hours researching and compiling this shit. 

\- Specific details in “Counterfeiting Stock 2.0” verified. Lends a little more credibility to it imo.

\- We \*might\* be fueling some of the HFs ability to keep going in this fight by purchasing their counterfeit shares. But our best option is probably still to **💎🖐️🖐️💎** and buy the dips.

\- Open the floodgates! File Complaints, email your local and national reps, and reeeeee

Housing prices go up and they go down. Too often I see people stressing over what something is worth in dollars, rather than seeing the inherent value in the item itself.

When the housing market collapsed in 2008, people lost their minds because their homes were worth “less”, but guess what, no one took the house away unless you sold it (for a loss) or stopped making payments and the bank foreclosed. If you just needed a place to live, and kept making payments, you kept the house, and over time, the market recovered and all that money that was “lost” also came back.

Stuff has value beyond the paper value. Pay what you think it’s worth and be confident in your decisions. You will always live in regret if you worry about prices only going up. Because there are always times where they will go down. Do you check how much your car is worth every day? Do you care if you buy a refrigerator and then it goes on sale a week later? Do you sell all your watches and jewelry the moment gold prices start going down?

Make decisions with your money knowing that prices will ALWAYS fluctuate.

If you buy a 🍌 for $10, and then 🍌 goes on sale for $1, you still have a 🍌. No one took your 🍌. And if you like 🍌, buy more 🍌.

Had to get that off my chest.

The animosity between bulls and bears on $GME lately is absolutely ridiculous. **BEARS**: It's not ""how this sub always was"" to completely shit on people for holding a position. Let them do whatever the fuck they want and anticipate the loss porn for breakfast the next day if you're so sure they're screwed. As long as you're ONLY dealing with money you have to lose, and not liquidating your ROTH to play a gamble, then you have every right to be here and invest like anybody else.

**BULLS**: However, the number of people saying it'll still go to the moon and downvoting every opposite opinion they see is a huge issue. They know that this event will likely stay on people's minds *for years to come* \- especially with the different studios trying to capitalize on the situation and sentiments real time - but that does not mean much for the longevity of your play. Already this week we see that we're at a point where we can exhaust the capital from the people willing to invest and lose all of our money in the process.

I'm personally **bullish GME, 69 $GME@98**, and it sucked to see the whole squeeze kinda fizzle out and into what it is now. Even though I'm anal about it, I'm **\*not using emotions to dictate my investment\***. I truly believe in the value of Gamestop under Cohen and the new VPs they signed on today, and a tiny little part of me is still invested in the idea of a potential squeeze in the next few years that I'm still not selling.

Truly, we \*won't know for sure\* whether there's the potential for another squeeze, short or gamma, [until those numbers come out from the FINRA this next Tuesday the 9th](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest). I've heard some say that it got delayed to the 15th but I haven't been able to find the source on this myself. Since the opinions on this are so binary, there will be \***\*no way of knowing whether this is all conspiracy or not\*\*** until we have some guaranteed bonafide proof that the shorts **\*\*ARE OR ARE NOT\*\*** in.

Until this point,  it is baseless to make a case about whether the squeeze is still on or not. Even the slightest confirmation towards the squeeze case will likely induce another gamma squeeze, since attention will be redirected toward a short-term high growth %; conversely, even the slightest vision that the shorts are out and we're sitting here floating in space will likely tank the stock with sales across the world - and definitely kill a conspiracy theory or two. The stock would likely only go back up when the

For this key reason, I think this situation is a 50/50 gamble. If you'd like to keep the gamble going, or feel like the losses aren't worth realizing, then fuck it. You do you. I hope you research opportunity costs related to bagholding and are willing to pay them as you move forward as an investor. If you're **\*not\*** willing to take the gamble, then **\*don't\***, and stop dicking in the ass everybody who's willing to make a truly retarded play; after all, the spirit of this place isn't so black or white...

Anyways.... Switchback Energy is a SPAC that a lot of you I’m sure have seen before. They are merging with Chargepoint.  This got postponed once and is supposed to happen this month sometime now. Chargepoint is the biggest ev charging company in existence. Chargepoint is bigger and worth more than blink even though Blink is priced higher and showing more market cap than SBE which won’t be right for long. 

As we all know, EV’s are booming and are the future. Chargepoint is only going to grow more and more. They’re the biggest ev charging company by far. 

I’m willing to put my money on the price of SBE going up quite a bit following the merger. It’s a pretty damn safe bet. And this is also a very great Looooooong position in my opinion as well. I’m going to snag some shares in the am as well as some more 40$ calls expiring march 19. I already hold 5 contracts but plan to buy 10-20 more and a grip of shares. 

TLDR: SBE merging with chargepoint this month hopefully. Chargepoint is big company worth a lot and growing. Great long position. Should pop off soon. 

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. FUCK OFF SEC. I LIKE THIS STOCK AND I BELIEVE IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE COMPANY. 

Positions: 5 40$ 3/19 calls.

Ape scratch head. Ape tell ape friends.

Okay, clearly there has been a lot of weird info out there and it is hard to know what is what when it comes to just about anything related to GME (or anything related to last week). Quality information is hard to come by outside of you retards.

That being said, short interest Tuesday was up to 20% of traded shares from 18.5% Monday and an average of \~17% last week ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)).    Today, that number spiked to 25%. I'm retarded, so I won't feign that  I   really know what this means. But it seems to this retard like 1/4     shares purchased today were sold short, and yet the stock held its price   (of course it did, we love this stock). I only have the brain capacity for two theories, and I'll happily take suggestions from the comments.

1. Shorts were all opened after the intraday peak around $108 to smack it back down to \~90. Given the all our posts are public information and we are clearly down to the diamond fuckin handers here, this seems a risky play for anyone that isn't already invested in the short side of this stock.   Confirmation bias: MOASS part 2 is still on. *EDIT: Turns out it is relatively cheap for massive firms to short right now (between 10 and 20% borrow fee), which furthers my idea that this was what happened.*
2. Most of the shorts opened this time were smaller short positions opened by boomer retailers crazy enough to gamble on this stock returning to its  ""fundamentals"" (wtf are those?). These smaller short positions didn't flood the market fast enough to counter the ask slappers that believe in the MOASS's part 2.

The MOASS would have happened last Thursday. It's why we are pissed. It's criminal brokers interfered with the will of the people. It's insane how coordinated the misinformation that ensued was. Now it's personal. It ain't over ever. I continue to like this stock. Daddy Cohen's got a vision.

Disclaimer: I buy high and sell low, so what do I know. Nothing here is financial advice. That should be obvious by the fact I titled this ""short interest"" instead of ""short volume""...

$GME has a MAJOR asset that's being overlooked...The Geist of the Squeeze,227,lc6lqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc6lqr/gme_has_a_major_asset_thats_being_overlookedthe/,33,1612438820,"(FROM THE HEART)

I started with 1 share at $350 so I could say I was here.

Now I got 15, aps $161.

I had no idea about the whole GME thing until last week.

I  bought the first share as a lotto ticket. The last two were the easiest shares I’ve ever bought.

I hope the squeeze happens, but if not, I still consider this an investment I’m happy to make. And that’s how I consider it now, an Investment.

I bought a lotto ticket on GameStop stock, realized I own shares in this phenomenon called $GME, and bought more.

GameStop is the videogame store that the slowest, flakiest weed dealer in the Chicagoland area worked at back when I was in Highschool.

$GME? I can’t define $GME because right now...it is simply *beyond.*

$GME is at the center of a movement that got support from AOC and Ted Cruz...AT THE SAME TIME IN 2021!!!!

$GME has been given the most aggressive, effective, and expansive advertising campaign in the history of anything...for free. Communist dictators struggle getting the same amount of coverage...in their own regimes!

$GME has…

\-A fucking $NFLX movie already optioned!

\-Mass news coverage, worldwide, real or not.

\-The FUCKING INTERNET

\-The rocket emoji (WTF else could it be associated with now?)

\-Customers buying and donating $GME products to charity.

\-People buying Billboards, all over the world. A free street team for everywhere!

\-Peoples. $GME could have more than brand loyalty, it has the possibility to “have peoples.” Like Applefolk. I really hope they don’t fuck this up. I hope to continue being a fan.

\*\*\*\*And if there are any $GME Execs who think something like “Well I wouldn’t call that adverti…” Then my entire thesis is wrong. But after reading Ryan Cohen's letter to the Board, I’d be surprised that someone who thinks that way would still hold any position of influence at $GME.

$GME Has MONEY with VISION. Have you read Cohen’s letter? I think I read it once two days ago after seeing DFV mention it in one of his posts. I read it again earlier today, but this time after having read Cuban’s AMA. That was critical. Between Cohen’s letter and Cuban’s wisdom, something happened. I ACTUALLY- LIKE DEEP IN MY SOUL- BEGAN TO LIKE THE STOCK!!!

So I stopped trying to daytrade FD’s to average down shares, and took a more intentional look at $GME’s story and plan moving forward.

$GME should be so much more than a video game store, in the same way that McDonald’s is so much more than a fastfood restaurant. It’s like when Harry Sonneborn went to Ray Crock and was like “Bro, you ain’t a restaurant owner, you’re a FUCKING REALESTATE MAGNATE!.” Ray didn’t know what he had... the template for a business that wouldn’t just disrupt the casual dining industry...it would DEFINE it.**WHO THE FUCK IS THE MACDONALDS OF GAMING?!**

$GME is in a position to wipe out EVERYONE in one of the fastest growing industries in the world. We don’t even know how the video gaming is going to mature as an industry yet, just that it’s gonna be bigger than it already is.

Cohen knows this, DFV knows this, any of you who have been truly following GME before the circus began prolly came to the same conclusion.

And Cuban knows this, but I think he saw something bigger.

Did anyone wonder why one of the most prolific and popular billionaires in the whole world might expose himself to possible legal or PR disaster, just so he can do an AMA on one of the most politically incorrect discussion forums on the net, at a time when it’s being watched like hawk by fin regulators? Not only that, afterwards, he goes on a PR crusade in support of WSB!!!

Why? **Because this is the place to be.**

And this pushes all those assets and ideas listed above to whole new level.

There may be something WAAAAAAYYY bigger than a squeeze, a turn around, or even the advent of a gaming empire. Mass Media hysteria, AOC and Cruz agreeing, dogs and cats living together! There’s something bigger that’s possible, and I’m not sure Cuban even knows what it is, just that it’s BIG and since he’s Mark Fucking Cuban...he made sure he was in it, but even more so, took a side and defended a conviction...For what? a bunch of tards chasing a squeeze? A chance to look cool in front of millennials? FUCK NO!...AND DOUBLE FUCK NO TO THE SECOND ONE!

We were all looking at charts, wondering what lines do, and scouring the sub looking for reassurance and more retarded DD, that I think we missed the value of $GME’s newest asset:

**#GME fanatics and the Social and Cultural phenomenon they started.**

What is the possible financial gain from the spirit (Geist) of the Squeeze ? I have no idea, but $GME is in a wholly unique and unprecedented position to find out. And this sparks joy and wonder in my soul.

I’m grateful to all the work DFV has done, but I'm also grateful he is no longer posting updates. The pressure on that man to hold...HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN? That’s the only comment for like the first 1k comments!!! It was to the point where actual lives could have been at stake if he didn’t post an update, let alone a stock price. Have you watched his vids? Have you seen how fucking chill and cool he is? It's insane to think about the weight he carried.

Nonetheless, I’m in because I like the stock. That’s it. But I like to think DFV has similar ideas to those explained above, and will continue to hold for the same reason. I also like to think there’s a few VC’s out there with similar thoughts. Maybe a few billionaires that are looking for something that can be truly Good and new.

Lastly, All of the radical and possibly delusional assumptions I made to come to this conclusion might be absolutely wrong.

TLDR: I actually like the stock. ",04-02-2021 13:40,73,5700,positive,0.3612,positive

I personally feel bad for DFV. Being the “leader” of this subreddits new 💎✋🚀🦍 cult following must be stressful and also horrifying. Also the government is now looking into him being the ring leader behind all of this even though he has months of detailed data proving that it was just luck...

Let’s say my assumption is true and he does cash out. I hope he gets past all of this and moves on to a better life. He has money to do whatever he wants and everyone wishes to travel the world and experience that lifestyle. My prayers go to him, his family, and future life.

Ape TLDR at the bottom you smooth brains

While researching batteries, I came across a corporation by the name of Energous (WATT). They are the leading the charge in a phenomenon called over-the-air wireless charging. Aka charging small electronics without needing to be contact with a surface or corded power supply, instead the device is charged by an RF transmitter.

Their primary product is called WattUp, the RF transmitters that allow them to charge devices over a frequency with a variety of applications - drones, medical devices, laptops, etc.

They have recently partnered with NewSound in December and received FCC approval for a WattUp enabled hearing aid, to eliminate the need to replace the small delicate batteries.

FCC approval for a WattUp enabled posture tracker.

They also have the first FCC permitted non-beam forming transmitter with a charging area of 1 meter, and a total of 230 patents as of Jan 2021. 

Finally, as of Jan 5th, they have completed a $40m at-the-market equity offering. 

This technology has incredible capabilities and could soon be found in any electronic device imaginable, and Energous is at the forefront. 

Currently shares are at 3.5~ from an all time high of 22.44. Currently both ITM and OTM options are pretty cheap with a nice average volume. 

Oh yeah earnings are 2/24

A rational (and bullish) take on the current state of GME gang,7046,lc5ciu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc5ciu/a_rational_and_bullish_take_on_the_current_state/,574,1612434947,"I see a lot of FUD and bad DD going around r/wallstreetbets, and its time for more rational discussions about the state of GME and the potential for another bull run. It is possible, but people need to stop being next level retard. It is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on what's actually going on. So while I don't know shit and this isn't real financial advice, here's a more rational take on what we need to do to get GME moving again.

Full disclosure: I was in GME in early December at around $15, I was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for Jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely. I got back in immediately for Feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k. I took some profits on the way up (I felt bad for doing so but I knew it was the big brain move, and in the end I pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me). I'm still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for Feb 19th, and made more 250 calls recently for Feb 26th and Feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday. I'm holding all of these till bust, so I'm in it to the moon. I have some shares too but those are a long play, I don't look at them.

First, we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done. The factors that led to it have changed, either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices (around 200 most likely), or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us. WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE ORIGINAL SHORT SQUEEZE TO REVIVE THIS STOCK. WHAT WE NEED IS AUTHENTIC BUYING AND NEW MOMENTUM.

On that note, stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume. What we need is real, authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200. But right now GME looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole. So how do we fix that? We still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the GLOBE that want a part in this once in a lifetime story. This is powerful but has to be used right, and that's hard when the brokers are shutting us out. But hope is not lost, and restrictions should lift over time. We need patience and resilience.

We also need to stop telling people who aren't in this for the moment to hold till they die. Some people are losing REAL money over this and we're being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies. Weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the FUD worse. If we want a come back we need the selling to stop, and that means we need to let the weak hands fold WHILE keeping the floor price above a certain level. Let's talk about volume. The recent 'low volume' isn't low compared to the past months, its just lower than the day when GME was THE MOST TRADED STOCK IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Stop talking about volume. REAL selling has happened, which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding. We need to let this energy run its course. Don't act like it's going to the moon and to buy at any price, save our bullets for the hard line in the sand.

Once the selling has stopped (and it will), we just need to regain momentum with organic buying.  People all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for GME to look like its picking up steam again and they will PILE THE FUCK ON just like last time. If we push the price high enough, we can trigger another short squeeze but it is NOT the same conditions as the first one. Stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks (which I've only heard of on this reddit) and us being cheated by the big man, that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable. It is STILL a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again, the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story. Whether it is or isn't, that only creates more FUD.

This sub needs to get its shit together. We need real authentic I LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK for reasons OTHER than the short squeeze. Like GME just adding a fucking Amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online. There is REAL REASON to believe in GME, and that needs to turn into authentic buying, which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again. But this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10,000 or bust needs to stop. It's just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief. This stock has real potential to hit $300+ again, we just have to change our mind set and the game plan. And I'm too stupid to tell you how, but I know this isn't the way. So buy the fuck out of GME at current levels, but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality. And tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going. We have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again, its not over. But its gonna require patience and time and if you aren't in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again. At this point, if you're not buying, either get off the ship or hold till death do us part.

Best of luck retards, I know we can do this",04-02-2021 12:35,62,5391,neutral,0,negative

I hope it inspires you, not to just ""diamond hand"", but to have perspective of your current situation and how it is but a chapter in your story.

""If you can keep your head when all about you,

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

Or being hated don't give way to hating,  
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;

Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,  
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

i know alot of people really miss and need some new DD like old times, so here we go.

**Corsair gaming inc.** \- one of the most popular in the industry of gaming and computer building\\parts. they sell everything.( keyboards, mice, headsets, controllers, capture cards, studio accessories, RAM, fans, cases,chairs, prebuilt PC...) the list keep going and actually covering everything in the gaming\\ streaming \\ computer industry.

corsair has just announched about closing on public offering by selling insiders shares( of their highest owners -EagleTree which reduced ownership from 78% to 68%)  8,625,000 shares 35$ per share with 30-day option to buy another 1.13M shares.

in addition to that some of the executives of the company sold sold shares at 35$ which can be expected because it is the first time they cashed since the IPO.

&#x200B;

**RISKS:**

* there's a risk associated with corsair bussiness which is they depend on third-party computer hardware, particularly graphic cards and CPUs, and video games. - if any of the above will see a decline  it may hard crsr business. - every year there's new GPUs, CPUs and video games, and corsair will be there to provide their equiment ! i dont see this bussiness declining soon, quite the ooposite - when people will get back to work they will have new money to spend on their PCs and game consoles, and dont forget about new stimulues.
* if eSports wont continue growing at the current rate and according to the excepted growth - there will be harm to sales.

&#x200B;

POSITIVE:

* gaming and creator becoming pupolar and keep rising at the moment.(not due to covid)
* part of corsair products are used for ""3 letters forbidden word"" mining.(GPUs and Power supplies)
* alot of rgb product that attracts young audience.
* variaty of products to all costumers (20$-1000$+)
* still and young company with a very promising future ahead !
* covid lockdowns made alot of people more aware to computers and gaming
* Alot of influencers marketing corsair.

i think that corsair is perfectly positioned to continue growing, at the current rate they are a value play at a steal price. streamers and youtubers marketing corsair products and as a result corsair can expect to keep their growth in sales. they can generate billions each year in the up coming years and i really think they are under valued right now.

combine that with the crazy time we live in, shortage all over the world for GPUs, CPUs and gaming consoles - the demand is crazy and corsair will benefit as well.

at 21, jan corsair just filed [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm) because of their latest ""offering"".

why do we care about that ? thanks to some guys from r\\investing i found that that apparently their next earning are already out and nobody talking about that.

**For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:**

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million**

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)):

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look).

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10):

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

And about their operation statement which looks pretty promising, this is how a growth stock looks, i see a bright future for them.

Why $SQ will crush Earnings (Earnings Play 02/23),70,lc52ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc52ml/why_sq_will_crush_earnings_earnings_play_0223/,42,1612434086,"**Preamble:** $SQ is currently trading at \~$228. They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\*T\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.

Here are my bull points:

**Seller Segment:**

* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of
   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.
   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.
* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -> more people shopping outside -> more small businesses profiting -> more $
* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).

1. There was a very strong correlation between B\*T\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\*T\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**
2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**
3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**
4. B\*T\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**

 **Other Bullish Points:**

* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\*T\*C. B\*T\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\*T\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**
* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:

**Bearish Points:**

* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling
* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL

I know people have lost lots more and still hold but I can’t lie I’m losing faith rn, the company is bullish long term but this isn’t r/investing, I wanted to sell half shares for 1000$, and hold the rest until Pluto, now I’m shitting it that the boat is sailed and I’m a bag holder.

 I can make some money if I sell now but I’d 100% be investing in $ROPE if it turns out I dimond handed too long to get nice gains; before paper handing before the MOAAS.

Merger Arbitrage between Aphria and Tilray. Free Tendies? What's the catch? Cannabis DD ($APHA and $TLRY) 🚀🚀🚀🚀,203,lc4y7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc4y7q/merger_arbitrage_between_aphria_and_tilray_free/,140,1612433731,"Cannabis 2021 and Merger Arbitrage ($APHA and $TLRY Merger Arb)[https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4403082-aphria-approaches-52-week-high-in-cannabis-rally]

So if you've been seeing the headlines of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer addressing marijuana, you're probably considering getting some exposure to the marijuana industry. Not a bad idea. I think it is a great opportunity, and it's where most of my investments will be in 2021.

But let me tell you about an interesting opportunity within the cannabis sector. $APHA (Aphria) and $TLRY (Tilray) are set to merge by end of April or May, and together will form the largest cannabis company in the world. $APHA is purchasing $TLRY, but the new company will move forward under the $TLRY ticker. So what does this mean? 

Well, currently, the price of $APHA is $16.75 and the price of $TLRY is $25.75. The exchange rate for the merger of $APHA to $TLRY is .83. For every 1 banana from $APHA, you get .83 $TLRY bananas. 

Lets say I buy 1 share of $APHA today at $16.75 and the merger is tomorrow. My 1 share of $APHA will convert into .83 shares of $TLRY. At $TLRY current price of $25.75, your .83 of a share is now worth $21.37. Remember, you only paid $16.75, and now it is worth $21.37 just based on the details of the merger alone. 

This also works with options, which makes me *rock hard.* Your contract of 100 shares at a certain SP, will represent 83 shares instead after the merger **but keep the strike price.** You can *literally* buy deep ITM call options at a steep discount. A $25 $APHA call is OTM, but ITM for $TLRY. However, just so you're aware, in this case your max delta of your option is 83 instead of 1.0. meaning instead of getting a $100 to $1 move, you will get $83 to $1 move. 

I know what you're thinking. ""Well that's why it's discounted dumbass."" And you'd be wrong. Let's take a look at a couple call options and their prices..

**APHA calls only go up to $25 right now, even 2 years out. So I'll be using $25sp**

$TLRY $25c Jan 2023. That option is $1,218 to purchase, or $12.18/share. 

$APHA 25c Jan 2023. That option is $610 to purchase or $6.10/share. 

You're losing 17% in share control of your option, but buying at a 50% discount. 

Anyway, not financial advice. Just babbling. Could all be made up while I wait for my crayons to heat up. Plus prices can change, but beyond your average red day there's no reason to expect a hard nose dive from either company at the moment, and instead looks like it should be a good year for cannabis overall. Maybe the best year ever, especially as an American, but we will have to wait and see.

Anyone who didn’t sell last week at the peak or around the peak, or on the way down, Welcome to the Bag Holders club. 

Now I know y’all are gonna downvote bomb me or be really upset about this shit, but it’s the fucking truth. 

We need to understand this and realise what our options are now. 

This place become a giant echo chamber of rockets and diamonds and “10k Is NoT A MeMe” bullshit. It was definitely a fucking meme and a lot of people got sucked into that absolute bullshit.

The big money bailed on us, they were happy to leave us bag holding if we were stupid enough to do it. (Spoiler alert: we were) there are no such thing as ladder attacks, everyone looks fucking stupid when they say this, the OG members of WSB are laughing at us all in a hidden thread. 

There is no squeeze coming. There is no more big money buying in. The squeeze narrative is gone, we can hold until we’re old and dead and out autistic grandchildren have our stocks, it doesn’t matter anymore. 

You need to realise if you’re still holding now, you’re now a long term investor. Congratu-fucking-lations. 

This is now a value play. Long term.

The reason I personally got in was because I believed this from the get go, before I knew about a fucking “short squeeze”.

I realised Ryan Cohen and his team are going to turn GameStop around and it’s going to be beautiful. Imagine getting on Netflix before it was Netflix, while they were still shipping DVDs? This is where we are with GameStop right now. 

The price will increase again, it will be valuable but it won’t happen for a long time. And it probably might not ever go to $400+ again. (Sorry bag holders at $400+) 

You’re a long term investor now if you’re still in. You’re options are this. 

1. sell for a loss now.
2. Hold and be patient, have faith in RC and the process.
3. Keep being a delusional idiot and getting laughed at. 

That’s it. That’s the options.

If the SEC sees this I am no way calling for market manipulation or cheating. I want a fair system for all, so we can all make the money and have all the bannaenaes in the world. SEC Investigators, look at the real targets. Melvin Capital , Robinhood , EToro , Citadel, and those in the White House. If we gain enough attention in the right direction the SEC will prosecute those who hide in the shadows.

My heart sinks.

This is a genuine discussion I want to have to further help GME holder’s understand the situation and provide clarity.

This is in no shape or form financial advice, but my opinions on the stock and what has happened. I am holding 296 shares avg $37.

Have we stopped to consider that the squeeze has already happened? That initial jump from 100s to 480 last week may have been most of the shorts covering. Shorts needed to cover approx 70 million shares. If you look at the volume day to day from last week, 70 million shares could have easily been covered, as these days have very *high* volume. This is even truer when you factor in brokerage restrictions. If retail couldn’t buy, where was all of this crazy volume from? Most likely, it was the 70 million shares being covered.

If it is revealed that the short interest is still 50% or higher, this may very well be because HF’s took new short positions in the 400s 300s 200s. They are rolling in the green if this is the case. They probably bought options to also hedge against any potential issues. If this is the case, the short interest will appear the same on our end, but in order for a successful squeeze to take place organically, the price will potentially have to hit $500 organically for the new shorts to feel any pressure.

In terms of percentage as well, the jump from early double digits to 480 for GME was a bigger percentage increase than VW’s jump from 200s to 1000s. This solidifies further that the squeeze has happened, and the squeeze we saw was bigger than VW’s in terms of percentage.

I know a lot of people here got in 200+. So it would be great if we could get some solid discussion going on challenging what I’ve said. For the most part, it seems the squeeze has happened and any new short interest has a firm grasp.",04-02-2021 11:54,45,1855,neutral,0,positive

My take- which is not financial or investment advice

1- Wallstreet is expecting a miss, which is good. They surprised eps big last time

2- They’ve been releasing nothing but fluff articles about forward rev and eps.

3- Just released teaser for raptor update(I expect an f series overhaul that’ll run into next gen. I know it’s only been a year but I expect and brand new f150 2022 as a preamble to the f150 ev line up. They’ve done 1-2 year gen ups in the past.)

4- guidance should be solid regardless of eps and rev. With new models coming out(bronco, emach, f150). We are in “recovery” at this point and f has already pushed multi-year high.

5- multi-billion dollar deal with... google.

6- said deal is for Android based os(expect googl to move as well)

7- dividend resumption?! This is speculation but with the positive outlook and possible beat on rev(or speculation on future rev like preorders) dividends could(not plausible imo) resume. Dividends come back so do the boomers.

Now, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.

What I like most about this company is their ""skateboard"" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.

It is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform. Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.

Having said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long-term hold for me.

Canoo (GOEV) currently trades at $16.40, hitting its all-time high at $22.30 in December. So, it hasn't had a crazy break-out yet but I'm confident there will be one closer to launch.",04-02-2021 11:44,12,2991,neutral,0,positive

## What is delta and how is it used?

Delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions. Delta is not a static number—it fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security, time to expiration, and volatility.

## The standard definition of delta is:

Change in the option price ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is delta important?

1. **Measuring expected change in option price.** Delta can be used to calculate how much an option’s premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a delta of 0.50 would be expected to rise in value by about $0.50 if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.
2. **Calculating the percentage of price risk.** Delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option. So, a call option with a delta of 0.70 has 70% of the price risk versus owning the stock outright. If an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk, they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas.
3. **Determining the probability that an option will expire in the money.** Finally, delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be in-the-money by at least $0.01 or more. Therefore, a call with a delta of 0.05 only has a 5% chance at that moment in time that the stock’s price will be higher than the option’s strike price at expiration.

2/3/21 **Delta: .3438**

**Every $10 up in stock price = +$3.438**

## What is gamma and how is it used?

Gamma is another widely used metric for options trading. It is most often used by traders with large positions, but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave.

## The standard definition of gamma is:

Change in the delta ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is gamma important?

Gamma measures the rate at which an option’s delta changes as the underlying security moves. The gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a gamma of 0.02 and a delta of 0.50 would be expected to change to a 0.52 delta if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Delta: 0.3438Gamma 0.055  (Delta+Gamma = .3493)**

**Every $10 up in the stock price = +$3.493**

&#x200B;

## What is theta and how is it used?

Theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an option’s price

## The standard definition of theta is:

Change in the option price ÷ one day change in time

Theta represents how much an option’s premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same. For example, a call option valued at $3 with a theta of $0.05 is expected to be worth about $2.95 tomorrow.

Theta can change as the options get closer to expiration. For example, options with a significant time premium (e.g., those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price) tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches. Another thing to keep in mind: Theta is exponential, not linear. That means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration.

## Why is theta important?

Time decay is an important concept in options trading. Theta is the metric that quantifies it, so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes. However, remember that theta (like all the Greeks) is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time. On any given day, supply and demand in the market will determine whether an option’s price rises or falls.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Theta: -1.36 Decay  minus $1.36 per day**

**Current price: $10.83 - per day x minus $1.36 = $9.47 price tomorrow if nothing changes.**

## What is vega and how is it used?

Vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract. Volatility can have a major impact on your options trade, so vega can be important for assessing the risk-reward profile of a given strategy.

## The standard definition of vega is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in implied volatility

Specifically, vega represents the expected change in an option’s price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility. For example, if implied volatility rises from 23% to 24%, a call option with a vega of 0.14 would be expected to rise in value by $0.14.

## Why is vega important?

Vega plays a critical role in determining the risk-reward potential of a potential option trade. If traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued, they may look at vega to decide which options and/or options strategies have the most profit potential.

2/3/21 **Vega: .0534**

**For Every 1% change in Implied Volatility (IV) = +$.0534 per pointi.e. 50% up would mean $.0534 x 50 points = +$2.67**

**Today was 373.1 IV - THAT'S CRAZY VOLATILITY.**

**The 52-week high for IV was 400.**

**There's a chance this breaks 400 tomorrow. ($.0534 x (400 - 373.1) = +$26.95 potential**

**Implied Volatility for Gamestop Corporation:**

**Current	        373.1**

**52-Wk Avg	97.3**

**52-Wk High	400.0**

**52-Wk Low	33.1**

&#x200B;

## What is rho and how is it used?

Rho measures an option contract’s sensitivity to interest rate changes, and is expressed as the expected change in an option’s value given a one percentage point change in interest rates.

## The standard definition of rho is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in interest rates

How is rho used? For example, a call option with a rho of 0.02 would be expected to rise in value by $0.02 if interest rates rise from 2% to 3%. Rho can be positive or negative, but has the strongest impact on longer-term options and is often considered less important than the other Greeks by traders who focus on shorter-term options.

## Why is rho important?

In a low-interest rate environment, rho has a less measurable impact on option prices compared to delta, vega, gamma, and theta. Still, it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longer-term options positions.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Rho: .0052 = +$0.052 per 1% change in interest rate of borrowing sharesi.e. if borrowed shares interest rate goes from 19% to 29% = 10 points x .0052 = +$0.052 extra to the option price**

&#x200B;

# The Summary:

**For every $10 move up in the share price tomorrow; the options price will increase 35.13% (based on Case TWO)**

**Case ONE:**

\[IV is +1% and Interest Rate Increases by 1% and Common Share Price increases by $10\] = +$2.19**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho = total basic greeks**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 for every 1% move in IV) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase) = +$2.19 (total basic greeks) / Current option premium price $10.83 = +20.22%**

&#x200B;

**Case TWO:**

\[IV is +30% and Interest Rate increases from 19% to 29% and Common Share Price increases by $10\]**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 x 30% move in IV= $1.62) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase = $.052) = $3.805 + Current option premium price**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE, The Analyzed Option Premium Price Increased $3.805 or 35.13% from Last price on 2/3/21 of $10.83**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: **SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE,The Analyzed option (Can't Stop Won't Stop Corporation 2/21 160c) Increases $3.805 or 35.13% based upon Case TWO with 30% IV increase and 10% Interest Rate increase.**

&#x200B;

**If there is continuous BUYing and HODLing of shares and buying 2/5 call options  and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers, the options price will continue to rise 35.13% every $10 increase in share price based upon Case 2 and can be even more as IV goes higher or Interest Rate borrowing % goes higher.**

&#x200B;

What would happen to the 2/5 Calls if the stock price rises every $10. Exponential Growth Possibly and the Final Squoze. The Share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion. If 2/5 and 2/12 options are bought up and share price increases dramatically, the price will continue to go up infinitely until the shorts cover or are margin called.

Even if the shorts are at 50% ... you can short squeeze em THE SAME WAY... by continually buying and holding you help make the price higher... even by buying 1 share... it has an impact because let me be clear... we are 8M... remove 1M bot, 1M media, 1M data miner for hedge fund... we still...??? 8-1-1-1= maybe 5M😅degenerates...

So heck if the 5M of us buy 1 share.... it make something.... and we know some of us got much more buying power... (for the SEC fuck you this is not
Manipulation, no financial advise it’s just a fucking obvious observation) 

That beeing said if we 💎🙌🏻 even if the short is 50% that 50% will hold like us and pay rising interest on their short until they say FUCK THOses retards we’re out and THEY BUY BACK THE SHARES... poping the price ⬆️ 🆙...  it’s not gonna have the same impact as a GME situation at 150%... BUT STILL...


TL DR... if you want to win don’t be like Davey and 🧻🤚... just hold and be patient and PLEASE ONLY GAMBLE MONEY YOU CAN LOOSE... 

Positions 3 GME share to be part of this at 110$

I believe more into AMC as a whole the squeeze and the AMC story... so 300 shares around 10$ and calls for march!

I joined around September of this year, and this community has brought me more joy than pretty much anything in my life. I've made some really good trades and some very bad ones, but one thing is certain, I have acquired invaluable knowledge in my time reading DD and from making mistakes. Now here is some information I would like to impart on all of you.

**DON'T LISTEN TO BEARS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME**

Remember, we are betting against bears, and we have a thesis contrary to them. This isn't a platform where everybody shares ideas and grows together. Yes there are people willing to help, but at a certain level, there will come a point where you make your own trades based on your own DD. If you did the proper research, you should trust your gut. Many people will shit on you, especially when it looks like you're going to lose, but that's just the way life goes. The road to heaven is paved through miles of clouded hell.

**DID ANYTHING CHANGE TO MAKE YOUR POSITION SEEM INCORRECT? NO? STOP FUCKING PANICKING!**

This is just like the time in The Big Short when Michael Scott and Co. are screaming at Ryan Gosling for upping premiums on their short position. Nobody knows what the fuck is going on at the highest level. This level of criminality is parallel to what happened from 2001-2008. I'm so confident in my position that I'm not even considering selling. Everything is so fucking complex right now, and when things are unclear or murky, there is likely fraud going on.

**BANKING DEREGULATION HAS GONE ON SINCE THE FUCKING REAGAN ADMINISTRATION**

Imagine that. We now live in a world where shitheads like us were banging rocks together at one point and now make millions of dollars to bang boulders together. Wall Street didn't get smarter, they just managed to get the feds to stop looking.

\[ROCKET EMOJI\]

Please guys, I beg of you, do not sell your position (unless you went full retard and bet your rent). At this point, we have nothing to lose, and they have everything to lose. Remember, Monke hold banana if banana no poison Monke. Silverback who try to poison banana cannot poison banana that Monke not give to Gorilla.

Trust in Mark Cuban. Trust your fellow bulls. Hear the arguments of bears and do research to refute it. A strong argument needs to hold water against a counterargument. Good luck everyone, I'll see you on the fucking moon.

Edit: Why can't I see any of the fucking comments. ALSO I SAID DO RESEARCH NOT LOOK INTO THE ECHO CHAMBER. BEARS DO HAVE POINTS THAT NEED TO BE DISPROVEN

Personal Risk Tolerance,77,lc38zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc38zb/personal_risk_tolerance/,32,1612428693,"Hello degenerates,

Some of you may have read my last posts regarding investing in BB long term as well as other stocks that dipped during GME’s rise. Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.

I probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can’t focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.

Many, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don’t trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.

This is how a stop loss works in simple terms:

1. monkey buys share for $100 each.
2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using “limit” or “market”, the monkey selects “Stop Loss” or “Stop on Quote” and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell
3. Confirm order

Congrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.

“Oh, but why would I buy high sell low?” Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.

It is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with “I didn’t hear no bell” or “IM NOT FUCKING SELLING.” That’s great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.

First, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today’s price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).

“But Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!” yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not? Well then, I hope this information helps.

(this is not financial advice)

TL;DR – Stop Loss good. Max Loss Bad.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Your comments reveal how little a lot of you know about trading. Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn't going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of ""only invest what you are willing to lose"" is completely misapplied here. 

If you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000. How about you invest $5000 and set a stop loss at $4000. Same loss, but much higher potential gains. ",04-02-2021 10:51,23,3164,neutral,0.0258,positive

Two weeks later? Three? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. Wall Street Bets in the middle of January was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of loss porn or memes or 💎 ✋or 🚀 can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and YOLOing in that corner of your wife's boyfriend's basement. Whatever it meant. . . .

Tendies are hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “tendies” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of all the autists and retards comes to a head in a long fine short squeeze, for memes that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty threads—or very early mornings shitposts—when I checked WSB half-crazy and, instead of cashing out, aimed the big $1650 Robinhood account towards GameStop at $325 per share, wearing cummed-stained shorts and a ramen-stained shirt. . .chucking rent money into AMC at $16 per share, not quite sure what my exit strategy was (always stalling at the sell button, too autistic to take profits while I fumbled for more YOLO money) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I traded I would come to a place where people were just as retarded and 💎 ✋ed as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any stonk, at any hour. If not across GME, then in AMC or BB or NOK. . . . You could strike tendies anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Boomers and Hedge Funds. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our autism would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of GameStop, a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than a week later, you can go up a steep chart on Robinhood and scroll back, and with the right kind of autism you can almost see the high-water price—that place at $500 per share where the wave finally broke and rolled back.",04-02-2021 10:44,51,2400,negative,-0.4019,negative

I know nothing and am 🌈🐻 that has not made up for losses since March last year.

Imagine you are uber-egotistical douche who stands to lose a lot on a ""should-die-cause-I-say-so"" company due to internet retards after illegally short selling more shares than there are. But that's ok, you practically own the MM Castle HQ and can do whatever you want. How to get out of this mess? Buy back the shares at a loss? LOLOLOL nah.

Step 0 - Just don't deliver the shares. Got friends in the right places so just do what you want. Oh the internet retards are saying there will be a squeeze and twitter just exploded. Time to be more active. Guess I'll go after a bigger fish.

Step 1 - Sell tons of massively high IV options on gaming company to build some quick free capital. Then sell some megacaps (especially those tech stocks that just had an absurd year). Make sure to do it quickly to really bring the price down. Funding secured.

Step 2 - Force price of gaming company down. Stop retail from trading and use some good ole fashioned short laddering to clear out the stop losses and paper hands. At same time, sow FUD using news buddies. Wait a second, why don't I have my big bank buddy from a few years back dangle something shiny in front of everyone (AND have tell everyone the internet retards love it) to divide and conquer?

Step 3 - Buy tons of the artificially dropped calls for cheap. A ton that expire the same week, and some more out over next few months. Same week is good because as MM I have fail to deliver rules of T+6 instead of T+3 so timing is the Friday after options expire.

Step 4- Bring the general market back up and hold it steady at close to, but slightly lower than, the prior high. This will drop volatility enough to buy a bunch of general market puts and volatility calls while still signaling to TA nerds that we could head back down with this double/triple top.

Step 5- Run the gaming company price back up. Internet retards will think its start of squeeze and pile on. Price will skyrocket again and at same time dump tons of those mega caps. Make it look like having to dump big names to buy back shitty company shares.

Step 6- Once it hits the right level, exercise the lowest cost calls to grab enough shares to at least cover delivery needs for cheap. Sell higher cost calls for even more absurd IVs. Longer dated calls should help with next few rounds of delivery; should buy enough time for this to fade. It will look like squeeze took place so even most of those internet retards will be out.

Step 7- Dump the megacaps again. TA nerds and HFT bots will keep it going. Profit off all the fear generated in the general market about impact of squeeze - always a bigger fish. Sell all those megacap puts for profit before buying back megacap shares until back up to level from step 1 at a discount. Or teach them all a lesson, by switching over into cash and safe assets and letting the market fall. Will get the news buddies on blaming those internet retards...

The hype is gone boys, we had our peak popularity a few days back and since then it has dropped, some people have sold and it all rides on us now, the core of this subreddit. Do not forget that we made this happen without the help of others, and we will succeed just as well without them. This subreddit, while big, was not this big a month or two ago. This has all been exponential growth. While hedge funds and Robinhood has screwed us over in many ways, let us not screw ourselves in the meantime. They have successfully made the most of these ""paper hands"" scared and they have sold... But if we remain strong, if we remain here with good faith with our fellow brothers. Then we can still stand and fight another day.

We do not need hype to hold, we do not need media to encourage us to hold. We know what has to be done, and I am damn proud of you all for how far we have come. But I am not saying this so we can feel sorry for ourselves. We are still in this fight and you better not disappoint the people who had massive gains yet did not sell. do not disappoint the massive amount of people who have bought a single yet crucial share. We are into this together and we will leave together.

Besides all this, again, I know this is hard. Some have tens of thousands of dollars into this, most of us are deep in the red. But once again, but without the meme, Hold. Holding is all we can do and we have to be strong.

"The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack - why GME’s real price is $2,147,483,737",16525,lc2dpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc2dpx/the_anatomy_of_a_short_escalator_omega_overflow/,2112,1612426129,"Hey diamond hands,

as I am sure you have heard, there are rumors that short ladder attacks are being used to suppress the price of GME. While I held this belief for many days, I am now beginning to realize that even more insidious and backhanded techniques are being used against us. I mean seriously, there is simply no reasonable explanation for why a stock should drop in price. None.

The good news is that Melvin is more scared than ever. The bad news is that today was no short ladder attack. No, it was far worse.

Today we experienced a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack

Most people here have at least a few days of investing experience under their belts, so I'm not going to dumb down these concepts for you. If you can understand a short ladder attack, you can understand this tactic as well.

Basically, a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack (or Overflow attack for short) is the opposite of a short ladder attack. In a short ladder attack, shares are traded back and forth, with each trade a penny lower. In an overflow attack, the attack chooses to instead trade shares to an accomplice at incredibly high prices. How high you ask?

$2,147,483,648

That's right, hedge funds have been selling single shares for billions of dollars right behind our backs. Why this price though? It's simple.

Every investment app, RH, TD, etc, use 32 bit integers to store prices. The maximum value of a 32 bit integer is 2,147,483,647. So what happens when it goes up by one? It goes negative.

This means that every share in an overflow attack is worth:  -$2,147,483,647

What do you think this does to the price of a stock? If you answered bad things, you are correct. The sale of one of these shares is enough to send the price of a stock far into the negatives. Didn't think that stocks could go negative? I'm not surprised - that's another hedge fund secret. They don't tell you THAT on investopedia!

But as the critical thinkers you are, I'm sure you will now ask:

""Why isn't the stock price negative right now?""

The answer is because the squeeze is happening RIGHT NOW. Paper hands laughed at the idea of an infinity squeeze, but it happened and it was big. So big in fact that it overflowed the price itself.

MATH TIME

So we know that GME overflowed in the squeeze. But by how much? Well we know that the price right now is $90. But we have to take the overflow squeeze into consideration.

If there is -$2,147,483,557 of pressure on prices, then to reach $90 the stock must cost 2,147,483,647 + 90, or $2,147,483,737. Yes.

EACH SHARE OF GME IS CURRENTLY WORTH $2,147,483,737

We can't forget about overflow however, so the price stored in your brokerage account is actually -$1,073,741,734. Now this might sounds like a scary number, but as long as you didn't buy on margin you will be fine. As long as you keep holding, the SEC will be FORCED to do something about it. They are already under extreme pressure to help retail investors - it's only a matter of time.

And as a side note: If for some reason Melvin stops this overflow attack, your stocks will be worth over a billion negative dollars. At this point, buying GME makes a profit whereas selling puts the next 10 generations of you family into debt enslavement. So as the wise investors on WSB say: BUY!

WE DESERVE OUR BILLIONS

If we assume the same ration for real total volume (higher than the one reported to FINRA)
That's around 22.7 M shares short today

If we assume that any other transaction was a cover then:
New shorts (not covered) = 3.5 M

The data since 27/01 is more than 50% every day. Meaning more shorts overall. 

It's still possible Melvin is out (at least partially)
It's still possible that they are covering old shorts with new one (like cover a short at 30$ keeping open one at 90$, or averaging up), new shorts are supposed to be more expensive in term of interests though

Very basic DD, consider the assumptions though.

TL;DR 
Short positions are likely to be increasing since the 27/01 according to FINRA daily data.

WoW Classic didn’t quite have the meteoric rise I thought it would. But I’ve heard great things about Shadowlands, but I think the MMO genre is fading a bit. But the money is so good.

And does Call of Duty really have that bright a future versus other FPS? Fortnite has Gen Z, CS:GO the purists, and Apex seems like it’s the closest thing to a Halo title. 

So let’s talk about what ATVI really is then, a mobile game company.

That’s where the money is, that’s how they support this valuation. The risk to consumer preferences is so high. Unless you all tell me you all play ATVI titles. 

Mike Morhaime started Dreamhaven, poaching Blizzard OGs, and really just about their whole hiring pool I would imagine.

The shortage has affected Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers. 

But why should we autists care about this shortage, Ticker $TSM. 

Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, ticker $TSM has only dipped their toes into supplying for the auto industry. 3% of sales were related to the auto industry in 2020. They are being pushed by these manufacturers to change routes to help supply for this shortage. 

From the article, ""In 2020, auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC's sales, lagging smartphones' 48% and 33% for high performance chips.
In the fourth quarter, sales for TSMC's auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter, but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales in the quarter."" ""Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.""

You enjoy watching xQc / Shroud / Ninja / TheStockGuy? You think live streaming has a bright future? Read this DD about $HUYA,13,lc1rjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc1rjb/you_enjoy_watching_xqc_shroud_ninja_thestockguy/,33,1612424425,"Long time twitch viewer, long time investor, 1 year old WSB member lurker. I'm a millenial and have been in the stock market for about 5 years. POGCHAMP.

Twitch is the north american leader of live streaming and I would love to invest in it. Here is the problem: Amazon owns twitch, therefore if you want to invest in twitch, you need to pay for amazon shares. Twitch is a drop in the ocean.

The only equivalent companies I have found are $HUYA and $DOYU which are both live streaming leaders in china.

&#x200B;

**BOOMERS have actually shorted $HUYA stock for 35% of the floating shares.** I guarantee you that the shorting boomers don't have the slightest fucking clue how the business model of live streaming platforms work. They don't understand the strong sense of community that twitch builds upon and why people would donate money willingly to their favorite streamers. I have seen the twitch viewers grow from the past years and I don't see it stopping anytime soon considering millenials are growing older and so is Gen Z.

&#x200B;

I know that nobody cares about fundamentals these days but just look at those numbers:

HUYA sales in 2016 (In Millions of CNY): 796.904

HUYA sales in 2019 (In Millions of CNY): 8,374.501

&#x200B;

The growth of live streaming platforms is absolutely insane and I believe it is the future instead of regular T.V. The market cap of $HUYA is only 6.1 Billion$ which makes it even more attractive for WSB buyers if they decide to like the stock. Considering the huge spike of interest in the stock market by the younger generation, and the fact that AOC had 300k concurrent viewers on twitch when she was talking about the $GME saga. It shows the bright future of this industry all over the world.

&#x200B;

Also, the gaming giant Tencent ($TCEHY) owns shares of $HUYA so this literally can't go tits up.

&#x200B;

THE RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT

&#x200B;

IMO, the real risk of this investment would be the content restrictions that can be imposed at anytime by the chinese government.

It doesn't concern me too much because even though they can decide to ban video games at any time, people still feel a strong sense of community with a particular streamer. 

At some point people do not even care for what video games their favorite streamer decides to play. A good example would be the streamer xQc on the twitch platform. 

My man can play overwatch/valorant and even chess. He will retain an average of 70k+ viewers every single time.

# ***No. We can not.*** 

That's market manipulation. **It's not even a good idea;** if you mean to play a short squeeze, every sale you make is a chance to let a short cover - and other reasons that's a flawed idea - but that's not my point. 

Yeah. We're all making our own decisions here, It's not wrong to discuss why we made them. 

**What we're not permitted to do is manipulate prices.** Some of the hedgies are used to doing it because they're not documenting themselves in the public eye like WSB is. 

We have to play it straight here.

#Update:      
There have been institutional players liquidating positions, too. I just read a (somewhat condescending) WSJ piece featuring a couple of long-side firms who were using the spike to take profits on a $700M position they opened in September. 

Not everything that looks like manipulation truly ***is*** manipulation.  Dropping single lots at a time would be the thing to do if you wanted to avoid crushing prices all at once with your huge wad of shares.

First of all, fuck the suits and GME 💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍 I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad. 

**It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come. 

If you want to talk fundamentals, it's something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass and putting it into small bags for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over. 

If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on. 

**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. 

**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone for Ford example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic. 

So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50). 

**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat.",05-02-2021 01:06,30,3471,neutral,0,positive

"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW) - Stock poised for breakout, and is relatively unknown, but certainty worth your time looking into with multiple catalysts for earnings this month.",1,lchjnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchjnt/atlas_air_worldwide_holdings_aaww_stock_poised/,1,1612479880,"Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that. 

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW).  This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up. 

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.

[Flying our tendies as you read this](https://preview.redd.it/2couglpv6hf61.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddd29a8ec3d6c527bbfc8ec8b32226525a58251)

The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.  In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.

The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.

They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet. 

A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.  If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The company’s cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.

**There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.

Sixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.

**Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.** 

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.

Literally Can't go tits up.

There is nothing validating about predicting failure, none, it only serves to demoralize your own side and in an effort to prove itself right. It is an excuse to not have to do anything because ""the fight is already lost"" while you feel super smart and try to pull down people who are not cowards, in fear that they might actually succeed.

Maybe we'll succeed, maybe we'll all be rich by the end of this or maybe we won't. That is a possibility. But trying to demoralize people around you does not make you smart, it makes you a coward.

I jumped on the hype train on thursday last week. I could have sold several times but here i am still holding and even buying more with a discount recently. My strategy is to keep buying more to bring my AVG. OPEN down to around 200.00 with the hope to cover my losses or even take off to andromeda. Is there still hope that $GME can reach 200+ again or am i just investing to lose more money? Also is this strategy of mine worth a shot?

Checkmate - The Next Step For GME,96,lche1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lche1c/checkmate_the_next_step_for_gme/,15,1612479476,"Lot's of new people in this sub and the posts are getting repetitive and way off track. I want to share something meant to help redirect our focus in general.

During this insane rally, the media has tried to script a narrative regarding what we're all doing here and why we're buying GME, and that narrative is far from reality. 

BUT.....we are playing right into their hands with all of these 'us against them' and 'I'm not selling, I don't care if I lose my money' style posts. It's actually KILLING us, believe it or not.

Why?

Because that is exactly what the hedge funds want the public to believe - this is simply a bunch of idiots trying to pump a dead stock in the hopes of taking down the shorts. 

That narrative is perfect for the HFs because the masses sitting on the sidelines wondering if they should jump in are thinking.....eh, idk. Taking on hedge funds sounds like fun, but these guys always win, the stock just plummeted, I'm not getting involved in that, but I'll root for 'em!

And the fact is, that is NOT what's going on here at all. 

We need to stop with the incessant us vs them posts. That's not what we need at all. Is there an us vs them aspect? 100%. Are we trying to change the way the system works and pull back the curtain for the public? Without a doubt.

But the most powerful thing we can do, what will ensure success not only for those currently invested, but for those who join us in helping to bring GME back from the dead is:

WE NEED TO SHARE OUR REASONS FOR LOVING THE COMPANY - OVER AND OVER, CONSTANTLY!!!

I didn't get into this play because of a short squeeze. That's icing on the cake. I got into this play because a savant CEO just took his world class e-commerce infrastructure and turned a 100k company into a $40B company in a few years. And he's coming to GME to do it again.

I got into this play because GME now has Ryan Cohen and his crew, along with Amazon's tech engineer as well as Josh Krueger, who handled fulfillment for Amazon, Walmart, and QVC. Those companies have performed okay, right?

It isn't very often that you have a company with this kind of brand recognition and nostalgia for us 18-50 year olds being reinvented by a team of proven leaders who have shown that they can get the job done better than most. [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) destroyed Amazon in their niche, and that's saying something.

What happens to the stock price when RC comes out and starts to share his vision? What happens when they name him CEO? What happens when the direction of the company starts to become clearer and the numbers begin to back up the potential?

 **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀** 

This is an AMAZING value stock. I LOVE IT!!!

If it's worth $800+ in a few years, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.

That all being said, if we constantly post reasons for loving the company, **others will see the value of the company itself and will want to support it's growth**. That's the heart of investing - putting your money behind a company you believe in and want to support because you want to see it grow.

This short squeeze, fast cash, fuck the shorts and stick it to the man narrative **HAS TO CHANGE**. It's not helping anymore and in fact, it's hurting the company severely.

Yes, we want to expose lying, cheating and manipulation. And it wouldn't hurt to see rich, greedy, assholes devoid of empathy get smacked around a bit at the hand of the little guy. Who wouldn't want to see that?

But that's not why I'm supporting GME and I know it's not why most are either. We need to remember that. And if we want to see this company grow and the price of stock rise, we should let the world know why we believe so strongly in it. That's not collusion. It's not organized trading. It's coming together to support a company you love and letting the world know why.

You know what will stop that kind of momentum - **ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING.**

And once the rest of the world sees what we see -

The Best COVID Stock You Haven't Heard About - Some DFV Level DD,0,lchcmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchcmx/the_best_covid_stock_you_havent_heard_about_some/,6,1612479363,"Sup Autists and Apes,

While everyone has been out there ripping call options on all the COVID Vaccine stocks, I believe I've found the real winner of COVID.   

Let me introduce you to Molecular Partners AG ($MLLCF on the OTC Markets), I like this stock a lot. 

# Who they are:

Swiss biotech company who created an antibody cocktail similar to Regeneron's COVID treatment.

# Why they are the next 10 bagger:

COVID won't been a global pandemic forever, but it's going to be around forever. Much like there are many seasonal flus, there will continue to be many seasonal COVID variants. This makes treatment more of a reoccurring source of revenue than a vaccine. 

And MLLCF's COVID treatment is the only which is not dosed via IV (like Regeneron's). **Which makes it the only COVID treatment that you can get in 5 minutes at any doctor office.** It was also recently reported to be just as effective versus all variants of COVID that have/can emerge.

# Why I felt this was important enough to bold:

90% of COVID patients never go to the hospital, meaning all current treatments miss the vast majority of the addressable market, and MLLCF will be the only available treatment for millions of people worldwide.

# Why I'm posting this now:

After reporting promising data at a recent healthcare conference, they release earnings on Friday 2/5. And even better, their phase 1 data is due out any day now (Q1'21 forecasted release).

# Why I'm in the stock:

I was first introduced to the trade by hearing ""Scientist, Virologist, Healthcare investor / Hedge fund Manager""

Michael Taylor (@biotequity on Twitter, he's been spot on with a lot of calls throughout all of COVID) discuss it back in July. Here's what's happened in the name between then and now:

&#x200B;

* Last summer, MLLCF did a secondary offering and their stock shot up 20%, the opposite reaction we see when companies usually issue more equity. The stock reacted this way as they only did the secondary offering after being approached by investors who wanted a bigger stake in the company, and afterwards, big players felt they hadn't bought enough, so bought much more.
* REGN's clinical data can be interpreted very positively for MLLCF's likely future success, as the treatments are based on similar antibody cocktails.
* NVS signed a partnership agreement with MLLCF back in October. NVS bought 45M of MLLCF stock, gave them 22M upfront, allowed them to keep a 22% royalty on future sales, and embedded a 165M option if trials are successful.
   * All in all, that's nearly a 250M deal for a company that had a 300M market cap earlier in 2020. 

&#x200B;

# Looking at valuation:

Comparable companies without data are trading at a 3B-5B market cap, implying more than 5x potential upside in MLLCF. ***To quote Michael Taylor, ""I don't understand how it's not a 5x""***

This is not investing advice, just some info on a stock that I like a lot. Mark Cuban suggested we do some deep research, so here it is.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

MLLCF will have the only COVID treatment you don't need to be in the hospital for, and 90% of COVID patients don't go to the hospital.

Novartis signed a partnership deal with them back in October that was nearly worth the same as their entire market cap at the time.

Their treatment was recently announced to be effective against all variants of COVID, official phase 1 clinical data is coming any day, and they report earnings on Friday 2/5.

If the trials are successful, which looks promising due to similarities to REGN's and others, this stock looks like it could go from 25 to 100+ based on comparable company valuations. 

**You don't even need to buy options (nor can you), and the stock may have 5x-10x potential this year.**

That was then, this is now, here's what we know:

* Wall street is rigged
* The buy pressure momentum got castrated mid climax 
* The shorts shorting at $10 probably got out at a loss, new shorts probably entered in the upper ranges and made bank
* The cost to all short holders is significantly depressed at the current market price. [Cheap shorts are available](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).
* If there was a day of reckoning when shorts all had to buy-in at once it would certainly be ugly, the numbers don't lie, there are a lot of shares short out there that may be impossible to cover
* The only way for a buy-in to happen is upward momentum caused by buy-pressure
* Unless you guys have a bottomless money pit or major market participants enter that's probably not going to happen

Why GameStop trading at $400 is fair,38,lcha0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcha0a/why_gamestop_trading_at_400_is_fair/,15,1612479147,"I commented this on a different post and thought I'd make it a post in and of itself.

I am basing this statement loosely on Chewy valuation which is around 43b (I know they are different companies but hear me out). 

First of all. Brick and mortar is dead so the turn to e-commerce is a move away from sudden death and a great growing opportunity, and with the help of talented individuals (Cohen, Amazon dude and such) they can really do this right.

Both Chewy and GameStop have (had) Cohen on the board and are operating in a growing market catering to a specific kind of customer (with games/e-sports being just as big or perhaps even bigger than pets). 

Remember, Amazon also sells pet products, however, Chewy found a niche and targets these customers directly with their own specific product. People like to be catered to by others that know what they're talking about, which is a growing trend.

Would you like bread from an official bakery using the best products or would you like prepackaged bread from the factory? The prepackaged food will do fine, but the bread from the bakery is just better. This same analogy can be applied to Amazon v GameStop. Chewy has proven this argument right.

This, together with the recognizable name, is why I see this trading at around $400 (in a few months/years) which would give it a valuation of around 30b.

DD on BlockBuster Stock (BLIAQ),0,lch8fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lch8fa/dd_on_blockbuster_stock_bliaq/,27,1612479021,"BlockBuster (BLIAQ) Ticker – BLIAQ

For those who do not know what BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) used be a nationally recognized chain that marketed itself as a video and game rental store. BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s used to be everywhere. A BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on one side of the town, another BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on the other side of the town. At their height of BlockBuster (BLIAQ), BlockBuster (BLIAQ) had an annual revenue of $5.9 billion. That’s a lot of BlockBusters (BLIAQ)!

Many are unaware that BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is still around! Currently headquarters in Bend Oregon, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is able to stay profitable by selling BlockBuster (BLIAQ) T shirts, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) cups, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) videos, and much more BlockBuster (BLIAQ) merchandise.

I believe that millennials and even Generation Y are beginning to spend money on items that they once loved as a child. This means going into a BlockBuster (BLIAQ), renting 4-5 videos and games from BlockBuster (BLIAQ), and experience the BlockBuster (BLIAQ) smell all over again. It’s BlockBuster (BLIAQ) tastic!

At the moment BlockBuster's (BLIAQ) revenue tops at 1 million with only 50% in debt. They’re looking to expand their BlockBuster (BLIAQ) footprint within the United States by BlockBustering (BLIAQ) the BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s.

This BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is a long term hold. Theirs’s no saying when BlockBuster (BLIAQ) will BlockBuster (BLIAQ), but I believe BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is going to be the new BlockBuster (BLIAQ)!

"PLEASE STOP CREATING FALSE EXPECTATIONS (and hold, if you can afford to)",105,lch7qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lch7qm/please_stop_creating_false_expectations_and_hold/,22,1612478969," 

**TL;DR: Don't create false expectations. Don't post biased and unfounded analysis. Remain silent and hold. Stay retarded.**

The beauty of all of this (this subreddit in particular and this whole event in general) is the fact that now, more than ever, the regular folk is looking at the stock market and curious about how it functions, leading to a socialization and democratization of the fundamentals behind stock trading. This is gamechanging, and will definitely have a lasting impact that we have yet to behold.

But democratization does not mean instant comprehension. What I'm trying to say is, we can now *access* the knowledge. It doesn't mean we *have* the knowledge, nor that it will come easily or effortlessly.

Stock Market analysis is a very complex discipline. Even disregarding the fact that the system is absolutely rigged (both in paper and in practice) to favour the big fishes in detriment of the little investor, there are still a lot of concepts and dynamics to grasp before one is able to make an accurate analysis.

Michael Burry didn't foresee a crack in the system by comparing two graphs and reading a news article. He had studied the stock market for over a decade before being able to detect the housing market crisis. Even DFV did a fuckton of research before making his move, and is also a financial analyst as far as I know.

What am I getting at with this? That your biased, unidimensional and rushed analysis (""GUYS, I LOOKED AT ONE GRAPH OF THE VW 08 SQUEEZE AND IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE GME, TODAY IS THE DAY!"") is not helping anyone but the hedge funds. Why? Because you create false expectations, which in turn affect morale and condition people to panic-sell when said expectations are inevitably not met.

The bottomline is, if you don't have anything productive and elaborated to say, you'd better remain silent (and holding), for everyone's benefit.

Thought some folks might enjoy reading today. Have a good one boys!

**Sperm Whale Theory**

1. There's a mega wealthy dude out there (the Sperm Whale) sitting and lurking on the sidelines right now, just waiting for the exact moment to strike and make a move; he's gotten fcked by hedgies before and he wants retail investors to win this time. Plus he knows hedgies are cocky and think they have this in the bag because they are up against a bunch of cash poor apes.
2. He knows there's still going to be big sales/discounts on these volatile stocks in the days ahead while short positions increase as hedgies and well off ""late to the game"" retail investors open new short positions.
3. This thing keeps building momentum on the retail investor side, with little nuggets of inspiration coming out semi-regularly that motivate retail investors to keep holding and buying to the extent it's not ruining their lives (i.e. management team announcements, RH and other trading apps loosening restrictions and not being shit heads, WSB community growing in popularity, govt. getting involved to increase transparency, etc.).
4. Legislation passes and US govt. decides to start sending more COVID stimulus to people.
5. The Sperm Whale, with his massive steel whale balls, opens a HUGE position, buying at an incredible discount of course, and ignites this mthr fckng rocket.
6. Retail investors, having just got their hands on $1400-$2000/each (collectively billions of straight cash from the govt.), go all in on the stocks they like.
7. The stocks they like go to the moon.

Thats now 29 million shares.

If everyone buys 1 share we bump up the shares that are NOT FOR SALE to 37 million shares...
This is more than half the total REAL shares of the company.

Lets say only 50% of the company is shorted.. they still need to buy 34.85 million shares.

# 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.

Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:

EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.

That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.

I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).

Forget the moon....🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to some kind of permanent orbit.

# 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises

On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price **SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share**. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one ""Kjetill Stjerne"" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would ""hold the line"" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like ""hunt=shortsells"". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.

After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.

What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:

# 3) Broker Restrictions

**IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS**[INTERVIEW](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html)**:**  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: ""We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses"". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having **TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES**. He also talked about how he ""saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses"". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro ""accidentally"" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.

# 4) Media Manipulation

It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the ""short squeeze"" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how ""reddit"" or the ""reddit army"" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.

Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that ""the short squeeze has happened.""

The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the ""new"" articles after doing a Google search of ""GME."" You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly ""new"" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the ""frenzy"", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)

# 5) Bot accounts

There's been a massive influx in this sub of [bot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/) that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.

&#x200B;

These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.

If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other ""next targets of Reddit"", Qanon comparisons, etc);

if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);

if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (**the next day**) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.

if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;

if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;

if there wasn't constant reporting about ""shorts have definitely already covered"" for weeks;

if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);

**if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options**;

if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still **insanely** high imo);

**and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;**

**Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.**

Peace Plan in which the Palestinians would have their currency placed on equal footing with the US dollar,0,lcgs23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgs23/peace_plan_in_which_the_palestinians_would_have/,4,1612477709," *Another idea that could be appended to what has already been presented would be having the Palestinian currency pegged inversely to the value of oil.... along with its inclusion into the Special Drawing Rights. This would mean that any decision by the Palestinians to fire on Israel would become directly tied to the global economy and the value of the Palestinian currency. Since the threat of war in the Middle East is often followed by a rise in the demand and value of oil, any hostility from Gaza(as the epicenter of mid-east conflict) could effect the price of oil by raising its value, which would thus(in turn) lower the value of the Palestinian currency that's pegged inversely to it. This implies that aggression would have a direct negative implication to the Palestinian economy. In any event, the control over the printing or minting of this currency should be allotted to the Palestinian authorities. This way the peace process directly incentivizes the Palestinians not in terms of land, but in terms of global economic clout since their currency would be intricately tied to world peace and climate change solutions, thus putting some checks and balances on currencies whose value is directly tied to the value of oil and the war machine. The global movement that is trying to get away from war and pollution is something that would easily aid the global demand for this new Palestinian currency.*

Serious post: to the 7 million new frens posting here because they saw some memes and opened a brokerage account with next months rent payment,125,lcgmio,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgmio/serious_post_to_the_7_million_new_frens_posting/,38,1612477238,"WSB was originally small-ish and everyone knew what the plays they made were gambles. Everyone knew you would probably not come out ahead. ONE successful play happens and everyone gets pushed out by a flood of 7 million+ retards who don’t even have any idea what they’re talking about. They’re just blindly repeating what another equally retarded person told them. 

It’s gotten bad enough that now I constantly overhear people in public talking about options trading when they clearly have no fucking clue what they’re on about. So here’s a few things:

1) “haha you can make so much money selling calls on GME it’s crazy” 

Because volatility is high as fuck and only an idiot would want to sell calls on an outcome so uncertain. Your loss selling uncovered calls is infinite. “Just sell covered calls” they say. What’s the reason you’d sell a call? Because you expect the price to go DOWN. Selling a covered call means you have to hold shares of the stock you are betting on going down so congratulations retard, you aren’t making money, you’re just minimizing your total loss. JUST because you sold some contracts and collected $10k in premium DOESNT MEAN YOU MADE 10k.

2) OMG *insert broker here* is fucking garbage and is in the pockets of *insert big business here*

Actually it’s probably because retards like you who have no idea what they’re doing are making dangerous plays and they know they’ll be stuck with the bill when your naked calls expire and you owe fucking $700,000. It’s basically them staring at a monkey operating a chainsaw and saying “fuck man, you are actually so stupid that I am legitimately scared for my own safety. I’m taking away your petrol canister”. 

3 “omg you can make so much money buying options”

You can yes. If you make the right play at the right time. These contracts are intended to be used as a tool for hedging, not a fucking investment in of themselves. If you fully understand the math behind them (you don’t, because if you did, you wouldn’t have just joined WSB in the last 3 weeks because of some random ass meme on Reddit) then there are some scenarios to justify making a gamble with options. For most people they’ll get lucky and just lose 100% of their investment. Some people won’t have any clue what they’re doing and expose themselves to potentially greater loss than $ they even had in the first place. See that one guy who sold $3500 worth of options to make a quick buck and ended up losing $700,000 and having to sell his house when they expired ITM. 

4 the landscape is always changing

You can’t hang on to the same old DD that worked last month going forward on meme stonks. Past performance does not predict future performance etc. etc. Don’t marry your stonks.

tl;dr YOU ARENT A FUCKING STOCK WIZARD BECAUSE YOU READ A SUBREDDIT THAT IS THE FINANCIAL EQUIVALENT TO SUCKING YOUR OWN DICK IN THE SHOWER EXPECTING IT TO MAKE UP FOR YOUR LONELINESS.

For all the things RH has gotten wrong, they were certainly very right in their graphical user interface. Seeing as how we have strength in numbers, perhaps we could influence our new Boomer broker overlords to keep up with the times. 

I've written and submitted a short paragraph to the technical support side of Fidelity in hopes that we can come together and reform the way they allow us to view and manage our money.

I've copied it below as a template for you smooth brained mongoloids to copy and or refine.

Good Afternoon,

I am writing in hopes of influencing Fidelity to update their current user interface between their mobile and desktop platforms. You are in the unique position of gaining a greater footprint of traders due to recent miss-steps carried out by your competitors. Fidelity is capturing a new wave of younger more technologically savvy investors who want powerful and elegant tools to empower their trading potential. We as the consumer have voted for you with our wallet. It is my hope that you place a greater deal of time and attention into the user interface to ensure you keep up with and stay ahead of your competition.

Tesla overvalued? Or auto industry undervalued?,20,lcgk08,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgk08/tesla_overvalued_or_auto_industry_undervalued/,29,1612477019,"First, I apologize for the non-GME related post. Just a thought I had. We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers have been saying it’s overvalued for the last I don’t know how long, or in a bubble (which, in all reality could be true).

However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft, Ford pairing with Google, and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the EV bandwagon. 

This got me thinking. Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford’s market cap is literally half of NIO’s (who has 7,000 employees). It’s hard to justify, in my mind at least.

I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional automakers  have in comparison to these other startups gives them a HUGE advantage.

But now that these guys are finally making their own EV’s, I think investors are starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well in the near future.

I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but very rarely that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an “energy company” and blah blah blah. What do y’all think? Am I stupid?

# The Hypothesis 

Many of you followed some previous posts on PRPL and have made a money, some of you partook in the great nrpling in the summer of 2020 and lost some money.

This update will be quick. I have reduced my total dollar exposure to PRPL but my exposure is now heavily leveraged with options.

Purple recently touched 41.00 per share and has since made a pull back into the 33-37 dollar range. I believe that the next leg up will require a catalyst and I believe there are 2-3 catalysts coming up. I believe 40 is going to be a short term support level and 50 is attainable by year end.

# The Catalysts

* PRPL is on the cusp of opening a new factory
   * Joe Megibow indicated it would open in February and 1-2 machines would come online almost immediately.
   * I expect a press release will occur when this happens
* PRPL will release a business update
   * Purple didn't give guidance in their november Q3 call. I believe they will issue something soon and if they don't then their conference call will likely occur in the next 5-6 weeks.
* New Partner announcement
   * I believe Purple is going to lean hard into wholesale this year as it has proven very profitable.
   * A nationwide partnership with Mattress firm would be a catalyst. Currently Purple is in about 800 of mattress firms \~3000 or so stores.
* Analyst Upgrades
   * WE recently received big upgrades from Oppenheimer, B Riley and Merrill Lynch. I expect 3-4 upgrades in the coming weeks.

# The professional price Target - 10 analysts, 10 buy ratings

# The Growth Projections don't line up with the massive capacity expansion

&#x200B;

[Analysts are basing price targets on only 23&#37; growth in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/gxi6wr84tgf61.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e235c043f0b08be182198bda89a015cac521ba)

* Prpl ended 2020 with 7 Machines and Joe Megibow indicated 4 machines would come online in 2021 with the possibility of a 5th and 6th also coming online.
* PRPL indicated they would be looking for their 3rd factory in 2021 as they would continue to expand.
* I estimate that Purple will conservatively have \~9.5 machines worth of capacity for 2021 and optimistically 10.25 machines worth of capacity. This would lead me to believe purple will likely achieve 855-1.02B of potential revenue. For sake of projections I will assume they guide on the lower end and over deliver, like always.
* Purple will likely end 2021 with 1.2B in capacity going into 2022.
* Purple has grown from 5M in revenue in 2015 to nearly 700M in 2020...... Dear lord, if you don't understand how impressive this is for a damn mattress company then GTFO.

# Total addressable Market and strong online presence

* Mattress industry is estimated to be 15-20B dollar business in the USA. PRPL currently has about 3% of the market.
* Purple is in \~ 1800 American furniture stores but there are more than 30,000 potential stores.
   * On average I believe that each furniture store contributes about 250 dollars per day to Purple's  top line. By my estimates, purple could achieve another 1.5B in revenue just by expanding wholesale further.
   * [https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/furniture-stores-united-states/#:\~:text=Furniture%20Stores%20in%20the%20US%20%2D%20Number%20of%20Businesses%202001%E2%80%932026&text=There%20are%2027%2C828%20Furniture%20Stores,of%20%2D0.7%25%20from%202020](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/furniture-stores-united-states/#:~:text=Furniture%20Stores%20in%20the%20US%20%2D%20Number%20of%20Businesses%202001%E2%80%932026&text=There%20are%2027%2C828%20Furniture%20Stores,of%20%2D0.7%25%20from%202020).
* Purple is once of the best known brands and although they only have \~3% of the market, the have a disproportional amount of brand awareness on social Media. Purple's advertisements have achieved over 2B in views due to viral marketing.
   * Purple hasn't even scratched the surface of other products such as travel pillows and other comfort tech such as ergonomic pads, etc. A travel pillow alone could increase revenue drastically.

Purple continues to have strong web traffic growth.

# The Moat

* Purple has \~100 patents on their products
* Purple's biggest competitor licenses purple's tech.... Think about that.
* Purple is digitally native and has vast digital presence and is continuing to improve Cost of acquisition.
* PRPL sources most products domestically and they were less affected than most bed manufacturers when the spring shortage occurred in 2020.

Be safe out there. This isn't advice and not all of you can get behind a mattress company, so do your owns research. This is my position as I believe purple will continue to grow healthily even with macro trends being unfavorable.",05-02-2021 00:06,38,5665,positive,0.4278,positive
A fantastic ETF trade (FTSE100 ETF but Americans can/should get involved too),17,lcgcdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgcdg/a_fantastic_etf_trade_ftse100_etf_but_americans/,12,1612476372,"Ok autists, please be gentle (as you can be) as this is my first DD – having had double my usual adderall dose this morning (prescribed btw) I’m ready to write my magnum opus.

Obligatory Disclaimer 1 – this has nothing to do with GME, I’m not encouraging anyone to divest their GME holdings. This is a medium-term play anyway so all you GME holders without extra cash can wait to see your short squeeze thesis play out and then come into this in a few weeks or whenever. Oblig Disclaimer 2 – this is not financial advice of any kind, please do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do work in the US as a risk quant for a pension fund (not a hedge fund) but the fund does not invest in any of the below and I personally make no investment decisions, hence being able to post this.

Brief bit of info/background on me – I’m a cross-Atlantic cross-breed, i.e. an American-British kid. 30 years ago my dad went to the US on business and met my mom who was working as a cocktail waitress (no she wasn’t a stripper or working at Hooters before you ask). I’m also 30 years old myself so draw your own conclusions about my backstory (just keep them to yourself pls). Oh yeah, as a kid a child psychologist diagnosed me as mildly on the spectrum (for real) but I think she was full of shit really. Other than that I’m a pretty boring/ordinary guy generally. My investment thesis is anything but boring however.

Moving on to the idea (you don’t care about me or my backstory anyway). Actually before then let’s talk a bit about the UK (or “England” as you Americans always call it in movies). I’m sure you guys think us Brits all sit around in tweed coats drinking tea and acting like Hugh Grant or the cast of the Crown, but in reality the UK today is pretty Americanised (London anyway). London is also the biggest financial centre in the world after New York, our banks are up there with your big boys JPM, Citibank etc. Also Oxford University (rivaling Harvard) just invented a Covid vaccine.

So onto the investment. Currently I have a significant amount of my portfolio in a 3x leveraged ETF in the FTSE 100 (index of the largest 100 UK companies, equivalent of your Dow 30 really). As a British (as well as American) citizen, I can trade this domestically on Hargreaves Lansdown, but I’m sure you guys have access to various ETFs that give you the same exposure (Wisdomtree for example).

Despite the vaccine and strong recovery/quantitative easing, the FTSE 100 is still down -20% from its pre-Covid peak, in stark contrast to the DOW or S&P 500 which is at its all-time high. So why is this? Good question – let’s look at some of the biggest constituents of the FTSE 100:

\- BP – remember these guys, the villains from the Deepwater Horizon movie? Remember John Malkovich in his bad Southern drawl saying “we are a $115bn company”? Well currently their market cap is $50bn, so there’s huge potential upside. Yeah sure electric cars are coming along, but in reality oil is going to be still needed for a helluva long time, especially once air travel comes back. Plus oil is also used in plastics and pretty much every consumer material out there, it’s going nowhere anytime soon.

\- Royal Dutch Shell – same as above, except they don’t have a movie about them starring Mark Wahlberg

\- HSBC – seventh-largest bank in the world. Up until recently their share price was the lowest it’s been since 1995, despite these guys making bucketloads of money in normal times. Also if HSBC ever go under, that means the world financial system has basically ended. So this investment not working out will be the least of your issues

\- Barclays – same as above, except they don’t have any issues/concerns with being exposed to Hong Kong/China. Also their investment bank has been making out like bandits this year due to the volatility. No idea why the share price is so low.

\- Lloyds Banking Group – as above, another autist made a good DD post on here about LBG recently. Look that up as the adderrall is wearing off so can’t be arsed to repeat what he said.

\- IAG/British Airways – huge airline that’s obviously struggling right now. But they have tons of cash and will definitely make it out of this crisis. Also down around -50% from pre-Covid highs.

\- Unilever – the guys who make soap and washing-up liquid. Everyone will always need these (well maybe not the filthy autists on here like me)

\- AstraZeneca – they just invented a highly effective Covid vaccine. Enough said.

\- BHP – huge miner, $200bn valuation. They are actually trading above their pre-Covid highs but likely have more room to grow.

\- British American Tobacco – the Covid pandemic hasn’t cured addiction, people won’t stop smoking anytime soon. If anything it might go up as people are stressed by the pandemic.

The above are just a few (the biggest) examples of amazing value stocks in the FTSE 100. Of course this is WSB not r/investing, so we need some additional risk. That’s why I would suggest a leveraged ETF, to amplify your returns. (Disclaimer – leverage also amplifies your losses, please don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose).

Ok, you say, well what about the white elephant in the room i.e. Brexit? Well this is WSB not r/politics, so I won’t say that Brexit was a monumentally stupid decision by our elected leaders. But whilst Brexit will undoubtedly cause pain for the UK economy as a whole, the impact is mainly on smaller companies and businesses. Most of the constituents in the FTSE 100 are $5-10bn+ companies, for example banks are big enough that the legal expense of setting up a European entity is minimal (so they still get unfettered access to the single European market). So FTSE 100 companies shouldn’t feel much pain from Brexit in my opinion, at least not enough to affect this thesis.

Well what about the exodus/brain drain of finance and other professionals to Europe, you might ask? Well Paris is nice but French labour laws mean you can basically never be fired or made to work late, which doesn’t really work for most big companies. Frankfurt is a strong contender to London… except it’s one of the most boring cities out there. Imagine moving from New York to Fargo, North Dakota – except that everyone in Fargo spoke a different language (although judging from the TV show it seems like they may do anyway). That’s what it would be like for someone moving from London to Frankfurt (sorry Germany/Fargo).

Ok, so what’s the risk level of this trade? Well tbh I would say the risk/reward ratio is really good – with a leveraged ETF you could conceivably make 100%+ returns in the next few weeks/months. And thinking about it this is really almost risk-free – if the FTSE 100 tanks or stays low for the next year or two, in reality that means we’re all still sheltering inside and now living in the monstrosity of a film that was Michael Bay’s “Songbird” (plotline – Covid has mutated to be 90% deadly and we are all still in lockdown in 2024). So at that point you’ll probably be scavenging for food/focused on survival, even if money still exists I can guarantee you won’t be upset about any money you lost on this trade.

Oh yeah, also the FTSE 100 was down almost 9% last month (January). So investment timing is also on your side if you go into this in the near-future.

Autist out (again - pls do your own research this is all just my opinion/autism)

**TL;DR:**

\- Leveraged FTSE 100 ETF is a great way to make 50-100%+ returns over next few months with pretty low risk. Consists of huge oil companies, investment banks that aren’t going anyway but still down -50% from their peaks (for no other reason than we’re Britpoors)

\- If this goes tits up then we’re probably all still quarantined and living in Michael Bay’s Songbird world in 2 years’ time, so money will be the least of your worries

\- Timing is on your side, the FTSE 100 dropped 9% last month for no discernible reason

\- Brexit is a risk but not that big an issue for these very large companies (see above in the detail)

\- If you don’t invest in this then you just don’t like money

\- GME holders don’t need to panic as this is a medium-term trade over a period of weeks (or even months) so plenty of time to hold your GME if you so choose and come in on this later

\- This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. Pls do your own research, this is all just my own opinion/autism.",05-02-2021 00:06,77,8412,positive,0.3182,positive

Honestly with or without the squeeze I'm just gonna hold my shares.

Well i bought it all back and much more to a total of 91$99 and I'm NOT SELLING 💎🙌. Many would argue Gamestop is worth at least $100 ($6 billion market cap) based on fundamentals but we dont use that word around here. Trust Cohen and let him do what he does best. Make ballin ass companies worth tens of billions in a few years. The squeeze may happen in time like TSLA exploded over the course of all last year.

I figured out the reason we didn't go to the moon yesterday.,25,lcg5u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcg5u3/i_figured_out_the_reason_we_didnt_go_to_the_moon/,48,1612475832,"it's me.

after a lot of research and soul searching, I've come to realize that I am the bad luck. I cannot invest for the life of me. and before you call me what I am (🧻🙌) hear me out.

I started fucking with investing about 2 months ago and have been adding a bit of money into my Ether account and watching it grow. it was wonderful even if it was small growth. time went on and I started to gain interested so I took about $100 to play around with and see what I could do with it. In a month of casual investing I lost $40. that's not much but I tried my damndest to turn any type of profit. alas I only made bad calls. like really bad calls all the time. I would throw money into something and it would immediately fall like it had bricks on it's feet in the Marinas Trench. It didn't matter how long I held for.. a few hours, few minutes, few days, as soon as I took my money out, that fucker would float back up. this was a constant trend and sometimes I would just try to make even the tiniest amount of profit (like $0.10 tiny) and was only successful like 3 times out of 50. I was bad luck. straight up. I even tried doing as much research on how to preform better with the free time I had. I still have A LOT to learn, I know that, but even the beginner strategies bit me in the ass. 

So, the ""first squeeze"" happened and I figured since it was in the news it was already too late and I mostly ignored it. but then I got to reading on here over the weekend and got convinced that there was another one coming. so come monday morning I bought in at around $230 shares and I was excited as fuck. I even took out all my Ether (the only investment of mine that was doing well) to fund this madness. it wasn't much. only 6 shares in total (I bought 1 at $100 too) so I hold 7 now. and like you already know. monday was the beginning of the downfall that we see now. the real kicker. Ether hit an all time high today and my funds were being chopped in half in the meantime. I was crushed. to add insult to injury, I added another 1K to my Ether account to make up for what wasn't in there because I really believe in it. ONLY to take it out at what I thought was the peak of $1530 since it seemed to stall, and hope to jump back in at the drop. nope, it just kept rising and now I'm too scared to re-enter for fear that it will only fall again due to past luck. 

so to summarize; every move I make in investing turns out to be a money loosing move, and my decision to pull out will likely be a money loosing decision in regards to loosing out on profit. I just know as soon as I pull out, weather it be now, or next week, you will all be fueling up to launch to the moon the next day. 

I Am Really good at losing money. 

with me here in the game you will all also loose money with me so I'm gonna opt out and bring the curse with me. 

I don't play the stocks, the stocks play me.

How the Hedgies Might be Decieving Everyone,100,lcfuvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcfuvb/how_the_hedgies_might_be_decieving_everyone/,18,1612474847,"The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

"What a know-nothing retarded skeptic such as myself is learning from the GME ""Squeeze""",33,lcfshx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcfshx/what_a_knownothing_retarded_skeptic_such_as/,11,1612474635,"So, this last two weeks was my first week in my life “investing” (legalized gambling really). 🥳

&nbsp;

If I’m on WSB, it’s because all you autists are so fucking retarded that WSB has become the funniest place on the Internet. And because sometimes, despite (or because of?) the collective stupidity, I learn a lot.

&nbsp;


Like: **How to lose money** 🤑 😭. Quickly. *Seriously.* Learning how to lose money is so hard. I mean, I only invested about 3500 total. But still, thanks to you guys, managed to lose at least 1500!

&nbsp;

But seriously, thanks! Because for a measly 1500 greenbacks, as someone who has never, ever invested I learned:


- how to use a trading platform
- how to read critically
- how to place limit orders and not market orders 
- how basic options works
- how to navigate insane amounts of hype, stupidity, and propaganda (the SLVR, BB, NOK pushers, which were always obvious targeted distractions
- how little power I have
- how even less knowledge I have.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

So here are a few lessons (which I'm still learning) which I’d like to share with y'all.

1. **Be critical of everything** - There are not only a lot of shills and bots out there (I’m looking at you, $SLVR-pushers!) but there are, surprise surprise even more autists. Especially with 6 million new accounts of presumably people who have never invested in their live, but in classic Internet-style, already tout themselves as steel-balled market gurus. From people posting data that’s [fundamentally wrong] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcds9k/short_interest_is_226_per_finra_do_not_sell/glz8xq8/?context=3), fundamentally misinterpreted, or coming to conclusions without enough data or just plain old confirmation bias (basically, all of WSB). Special shoutout to [u/smohyee's] (https://www.reddit.com/user/smohyee) very [sober post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/) which helped me look critically at stuff that has been flying around the forum these last days.

2. **Don’t underestimate my ignorance** - I know nothing. Literally nothing. I can do basic addition and subtraction, and know stocks go up and down. Personally, the market seems like a huge insane bubble ready to burst at any second. But maybe not. What do I know? 🤷‍♂️ I’m as autistic as you. 🤤

3. **Get in before the hype** - Even to my stupid, ignorant self, I realized buying GME at an all-time high of 150X its low, was a stupid idea. Especially when the entire Internet and even non-Internet media was buzzing with the hype. *3B. (Corollary). - If you are going to go up against a Hedge fund with is 10000X more powerful than you, don’t announce all your moves up front.* 
 
4. **Understand what the statistics and metrics mean before betting (I mean: ""investing"")** - People are posting volume data, short interest numbers, using fancy lingo and stats that I still can’t wrap my brain around (I still haven’t understood how you can sell a put you don’t have for example, that’s how ignorant I am). But, as the wise men & women say - ignorance is an opportunity to redeem yourself.

5. **Don’t underestimate all the other players** - Hedge funds, Retirement funds. Whales. They all have different agendas. And their agendas are not yours. The worst mistakes I saw were not acknowledging the special advantages that institutional investors will always have. This is not *cheating*. This is how the market works. You can be a crybaby autist about it, but that’s how it is (I wrote a bit about some of the advantages even I saw that HF have [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbifwv/a_skeptics_post_can_wsb_win_the_gme_standoff_even/) - me, who knows nothing about investing). Institutional Investors have sentiment trackers, high-speed algorithms, inside information, battle-hardened experience, tricky tactics, etc. You are not going to beat any Hedge Fund of Institutional Investor at a game they invented, made the rules in, and excel at.

6. **Expertise is valuable** - There is a very good reason why finance jobs, especially at Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity firms are the best-paid jobs in the world - because they places hire very fucking smart people, who work very fucking hard (7 days a week, 14-hour days), to be better at this than you or I. The expectation that we be as good as them, is like expecting to pop out of your mom’s womb and run a 100m faster than Usain Bolt without a day’s training. The reason we don’t like Hedge Funds or the stock market in general, is it is because it a casino for the wealthy. We are the poor schlubs sitting at the 1 dollar blackjack table, while watching the billionaires in their Tuxedos coming out of their Bentley’s to play at the million dollar poker tables. From a recent Economist article this week: *“Even in America stock market gains have mainly accrued to the rich. The wealthiest 1% owns 56% of the stock market, up from 46% in 1990; the top 10% owns 88% of the market.”*

7. **The HF didn’t cheat. They don't need to. They hustled** - They invited ignorant newbies to sit at their tables (yes, that’s us), and then fleeced us of our cash. We are idiots, because we KNEW the hustle was coming and we KNEW the pros were pros, and yet we STILL played against them.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Little reminders for myself for next time:**

1. **Accept the risk** - Any money I gamble in this friggin casino I can count as lost.
2. **If you have no clue, don’t bet** - I have no clue what a “Calendar Call” or a “Vertical Call” is. You can bet I won’t be making that, until I do.
3. **Losing (preferably a little bit) of money, is a very strong motivation to learn.**

&nbsp;

And a li’ tip for my fellow autists:

**Don’t post fucking DDs if you are an ignorant shit.**

&nbsp;

Positions - Holding 215 AMC (115 bought  (stupidly, and during the hype) @14; 100 bought during a dip @ 8.11)
Holding 2 GME (1 free from RH, 1 bought at 115)
1 SPY put 332; EXP 03/31

&nbsp;

Final final note (for real, this time):

&nbsp;

***If you think the stock market is unfair, you are right. Unfair is the very core foundation of capitalism. If you really really are pissed off at capitalism and hedge funds, have the balls to be socialist or a marxist; refuse to participate in the free market; and refuse to consume.

&#x200B;

Before GME gang downvotes:

Listen up this isn't r/GME this is r/wallstreetbets I know you have your battles to buy but we shouldn't miss out on SLV just because you guys like GME still. OF course dont sell GME to buy SLV just hold and wait for the squeeze but we must recognise that SLV is ACTUALLY a legit play.

If you want to check that i'm not a robot send me captchas and ill do them for you

&#x200B;

Recently there have been a few posts about SLV, but I tried to wait until the GME hypes has died down to post this. This DD will be split into two parts:

1. Why SLV in on itself is a good and safe investment (Boomer DD)
2. Why SLV has moon mission potential (WSB DD)

**We should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in GME. You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.**

**The Boomer DD (Source: goldsilver.com)**

*Why silver is a good investment*

Silver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.

Silver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.

&#x200B;

[Gold vs Silver](https://preview.redd.it/bjnbtrtjpgf61.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=4536c7c77ab04631c9de08daf8caae9dc2c6ba11)

Government inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8uf985knpgf61.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=41c26d5a8d97396556e07a1c9b5d218660cac6da

&#x200B;

Silver use in industrial production is also increasing.

There is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.

One key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.

Photovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it [here](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/how-does-photovoltaic-cell-work)

On average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.

&#x200B;

[China needs silver but can't get it](https://preview.redd.it/mx8ng1mppgf61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28b940133f96c3c4934fbe3490cf557117ac5ec)

*Silver supply is dropping*

Silver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped 72.1%, silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.

&#x200B;

[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)

&#x200B;

So to conclude the boomer DD:

\- Inflation is on the rise

\- Too much money is being printed

\- Silver outperforms gold

\- Silver biggest use is industrial use

\- Silver demand is increasing

\- Silver supply is dropping

**WSB DD 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

&#x200B;

According to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Some tweet they put on their site idk 🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)

&#x200B;

Of course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )

I'm just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.

Also, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going ""Hey guys i'm a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you"" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.

1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF's because they don't buy physical silver)
2. Silver price go up
3. JP Morgan ANGRY
4. Robinhood and other brokers experience ""temporary outages"", ""Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason"" , ""Limiting SLV shares that can be bought""
5. WSB and noobs who don't know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something

Basically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.

Whether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it's heavily debated and I don't know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.

Maybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold

&#x200B;

**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**

I have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is

\- One contract is too expensive

\- People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with it

\- Its taking attention away from GME

&#x200B;

*One contract is too expensive*

The contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver

1. But silver futures and take delivery
2. Buy SLV shares
3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers

There are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don't believe me check for yourself.

&#x200B;

*People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*

See above

&#x200B;

*Its taking attention away from GME*

I am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn't mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn't miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**

**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**

**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**

**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**

&#x200B;

**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**

Almost every household owns some silver. Whether its' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don't know.

If silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.

Poor people don't how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don't know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don't have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don't have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with ""What is a broker"" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say ""Buy silver lol"" than ""Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose....""

If you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don't transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.

TLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don't need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \[When you don't pay for a product you ARE the product\])

Regardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.

$GME Short Interest Data.,94,lcfluf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcfluf/gme_short_interest_data/,28,1612474041,"Hi everyone,

I keep seeing comments/questions about short interest. I use Ortex & S3 to get a read on trends. From my experience, they are usually within 10% of the exchange reported interest.

|Date|High Price|Estimated Short Interest|Change in Short Interest|

|25-Jan|159|71.4M|441.4K|

The hedge funds cleared a lot of short interest from Jan 27-Jan 29. This caused $GME price to spike. They didn't do it all at once, but instead did it slowly. We saw a squeeze that looked more like rolling hills.

This week, they're playing a new game. They're holding their short position relatively flat & even doubling down.

Some will say these are people who shorted at $400 instead of $40. Unless you think hedge funds are fortune tellers, I think we can agree that the original 70M were closer to the $40-$80 mark. You see the kind of price pressure we see on the days where they cleared 9-15M? I do not believe they cleared the full 70M otherwise we would have seen more price pressure on surrounding days.

Thoughts?

Email from RH:

Important information about your options expiring 2/5

Hi Kaitlin,

We’re reaching out to you because you have GME and/or AMC options expiring this Friday and our standard sellout procedures have been adjusted to account for increased volatility in the underlying equities.

Because of this, on Friday, your GME and/or AMC options expiring 2/5 may be at a higher chance than usual of being closed out if you are unable or choose not to close them out yourself.

We understand this may be frustrating to hear, but we want to be transparent with you and keep you informed.

How does this affect me?

If we determine that your option contract is at risk of being in the money and you don’t maintain the necessary collateral to support assignment/exercise, we may take proactive measures to help reduce your account risk, including closing at-risk positions prior to expiration date. This may also include, but isn’t limited to, spread positions with a theoretical max gain/loss.

Please note that having the collateral to place the trade is different from having the collateral to support exercise/assignment.",04-02-2021 23:22,107,1857,neutral,0,positive

When I hear that, I think of the people who defended the Catholic Church over child abuse scandals, those who bought into pharmaceutical company propaganda, and those who defends some prominent politicians whom I shall not name over certain things. In general, brainless twats.

Where there is motive for profit or the prevention of loss thereof, there is action. I don’t know what RH did behind the doors, but I know they are motivated to do what they did. I don’t know what tactics HFs have or have not used, but I know they are motivated. SEC fuckers are also motivated bc they always have been.

So I am gonna believe that RH and vlad tenev and the hedge funds conspired to bring down GME, I am gonna believe that SEC and yellen are getting their big paydays by Wall street.

Just because I can’t pinpoint a specific evidence doesn’t mean that jack shit. Our courts have put people away for less.

My beliefs may not be exactly true, but they are certainly closer to truth than believing that RH HFs SEC and interested parties didn’t do anything illegal just because there is yet concrete evidence.

So hold those fucking GME shares, because I know those fuckers want them so bad that they will do anything to take it off your hands.

Just because someone hypes up a stock doesn’t mean that you should invest. It’s always up to **YOU** and the amount of time you’re willing to spend **RESEARCHING** the stock. I know that’s not what WSB initially stood for, most of us just came here for the loss / gain porn. But now that the attention of SEC, media and hedge funds has been drawn onto us, it’s important to differentiate hype and rational, critical thinking. 

None of us here buys stocks because **SOMEONE** tells us to do so. We make our own fucking choices and we accept the losses and welcome the gains. 

Regarding the current situation: based on informative posts and comments I’ve had the pleasure of reading, it looks like it’s going to be a long and weary battle. But at the end of the day, what differentiates you from a paper handed bitch and a legitimate retard, are the reasons behind your investing decisions. 

***Do you really believe that GME is an undervalued company (in general)? Do you believe that GME has the potential to expand into something truly beautiful and magnificent, especially after all the traction the company’s been having over the course of last month? Do you trust the company?*** 

If you do, then you’ve got nothing to worry about - even if the stock price dips to $50-60. Investing’s never about making a quick buck, sure there are those who get lucky every now and then, but if you invest with the “I make quick gains” mindset, chances are you’ll lose. Because you’re investing in a highly volatile, unpredictable market that has a history of crashing at the slightest of inconveniences.

The thought of waking up in a few days, weeks - heck even months and looking on my phone and seeing the damage that we'll inevitably cause if the holding continues, that drives me.

&#x200B;

# I. current Situation

As all people here obviously noted, there is a war going on between hedge funds, retail investors and other people in the background including media, reddit, celebrities.

Everyone has their play, everyone wants money, fame, leverage, whatever.

There is a split here in reddit, some just want gainz, some want to keep the ""movement"" going, and some kinda want both.

&#x200B;

**FYI I'm neither.** I'm not invested in GME or anything else, as a matter of fact, I'm a stock virgin. I'm a pretty high earning, not 1% high, but I get a fucking good salary for my age and this will only rise. So I'm not in financial danger in any way, but I have close relationship to my money in terms of not losing it.

I wanted to buy GME, but at any given point except last wednesday I was looking at dangerous numbers either too volatile for me to get in or going down.

&#x200B;

# II. what we REALLY know

We know: hedge funds shorted GME and others. We dont know from where exactly, we dont know exactly when, and as a matter of fact, we dont know how much. ALL the data we have is either outdated, not a good source or just flat wrong. SI might sit at 200% right now, that would tell us nothing. Those could be shorts started at 300 and hedges want to earn even more, those could be shorts started at 20, 90 or 180$.

&#x200B;

At this moment, **even SI is not helping us making decision**s, even if we would know the true number.

We know the stock is very **volatile** right now, we dont really know why. Short ladder attacks are a myth, I hope this is cleared by now.

&#x200B;

What is **obvious**, is that there is market ""**manipulation**"". Manipulation derives from latin ""manus"", meaning by hand. That is for sure. We know hedge funds and even us change the stock price by hand somehow. If it is by buying, holding, selling, shorting, fake news, true news, whatever.

&#x200B;

# III. What does that all mean now

It means, the short squeeze could already be over, it could mean we are in it, but it was heavily fought against by any means including unfair ones. It could mean squeeze is still in the future waiting.

&#x200B;

What it means for the stock: It will stay volatile. It might stay at 90$ for some time, as long as retailes still buy in, and maybe even other hedge funds or whales. It might drop, it might even rise, **maybe hedge funds bought in right now and want to keep the momentum upward and sell at a specific point, crushing the price with retailers beeing the bagholders.**

What does it mean for us retailers?

Its dangerous to invest into this stock. Nothing is safe, diamond handing this could end in GME dropping to 20$ again and this might stay the case for a long time. It might work and stock price goes into 1000$.

&#x200B;

# IV. Whom are we fighting?

It is important to note, that we are fighting a multibillion dollar cartel of people who are deep into the stockmarket since beginning of stock trading. Basically, they know every trick and more. Do you guys really think, they have no idea how to fight retailers? They might do ""ladder attacks"" because they shorted the stock again and now stop, just to buy into GME? They might want us all to hold just so the price rises until EXACTLY 299$ when they will sell 10mm shares and price drops to 90$ again.

They might want to ride the rocket to the moon, too. They might want the whole stock to drop to 10$, who knows.

&#x200B;

It is important to know, that they analyse this whole sitation and make their own plan.

&#x200B;

# V. What is the danger here?

&#x200B;

This is a reddit. We are 8,5mm degenerates on this sub and latest after last week hedge funds are monitoring this. So what is the problem? If reddit is monitored, they might even use this, for example, **they know a ton of people will cling to this stock with their life, not even thinking about selling if it is 98% down**. I have no fucking clue what a good trader could do with this info, but I'm betting it is dangerous for the people on here invested in GME.

&#x200B;

# VI. What shall we do, what is the future?

&#x200B;

I have no fucking clue. Personally, if I already had invested in GME, there would be 2 possible situations:

I got in below todays market price. For example like all those guys with 10k shares at 20$. They are still hugely in the green. I personally would propably have secured some cash at 400$, but I would definitly secure some cash now, depending how much I'm in. I would keep at least a good portion of the stock in hopes in goes moon.

&#x200B;

If I got in above todays market price, let's say at 150, I would think about getting out anytime the stocks goes above 100$ again and try to minimise my loss, IF the money is a lot for me or I need it.

&#x200B;

If it is gamble money, I would stay invested, but would be pessimistic enough to not hope for rocketfuel.

# VII. What if the rocket goes moon, when do I sell

A false impression that was created here is that everyone, at any point buying into GME would make tons of tendies. That is WRONG. Usually, in situations like this, early adopters make tons of tendies (DFV for example or anyone who got in at 20$ dollar range). Then at some point, let's say stock price hits 1000$. Now what happens if everyone and their mother sells at exactly that point? First 10000 sellers get their 1000$ price. But pretty fast, price drops immensly. This will end in a downward spiral (see VW short squeeze graph). With tons of people not making huge bank or even lose money, IF they got in late. (think 300$ range and sell the last)

&#x200B;

So what could be an exit strat be?

**I would say, the later you got in, the earlier you sell.**

That makes sure you exit in the GREEN, and not accidentally in the red. I wont sell at 350 if I got in at 300. But I wouldnt wait out a mass selloff and then might drop under 200$ and still lose money after I tripled my money.

&#x200B;

**Last words from a stock virgin and TLDR:** This whole story is crazy and cool, and **I hope all of ya earn tons of tendies**. But PLS for the love of god, IF stock raises again and you see overall black numbers, and this is your fucking **retirement money**, GET IT FUCKING BACK and cash out. This is not a game.

This whole dream of becoming a rich tendie ape is not worth beeing homeless because stocks treat retailers like bitches. This whole thing might work out. But you're against a multibillion dollar cartel that does EVERYTHING to make money or keep money. They shit on every rule, just to stay on top.

Questions about GME,31,lcf03b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcf03b/questions_about_gme/,11,1612472002," 

Hey guys,

I've been lurking in the sub for 1 year and participate in some trades that get quite popular in the sub, obviously one of them being GME. I currently hold 90 positions @ avg $80 and continuing to diamond hand this fuck out of this squeeze.

I'm a retard so i need a smarter retard to explain some shit to me :

1. At this moment, if everyone holds I do not see any possibility for us to lose this war since one day the hedgies will have to pay back the float since there is a 226.42% interest float and 88.56% of the shorts are outstanding according to Yahoo Finance so why has this suddenly become very risky for people?
2. Price doesn't matter if nobody sells, but if the hedges attempt Naked Shorts will the price matter?
3. Ideally this could go on forever since Hedges make millions if not billions in interest and can afford to keep attacking the price day by day and covering shorts as people begin to get bored or sell so how do we know a short squeeze will happen?
4. How can we lose?

Either way, I'm going to Diamond Hand this shit to fucking Pluto or go down fighting the corrupt dicks.",04-02-2021 22:53,19,1113,neutral,0,negative

Didn't expect to have a response, but just got this in. This has been suggested before here, so be like Koko, don't throw shit, relay your concerns like the cultured apes we are.

""Thank you for writing to me with your concerns regarding the trading of stocks like GME and AMC. Your thoughts on these important matters are most welcome and appreciated.

As you mentioned, after an unexpected surge in gains for stocks such as GME, certain financial services institutions and trading platforms suspended the trading of this and other stocks on January 28, 2020. These trading restrictions have since raised questions regarding the legality of barring smaller, retail investors from participating in stock trading during periods of volatility. Like you, I have serious concerns about brokerage platforms putting in place restrictions, which limit the free trading of stocks and options, especially when those restrictions disproportionately benefit large hedge fund operators at the expense of individual investors.

In recent years, online brokerage platforms have made the stock market more accessible to individual retail investors. While this progress is important in allowing everyday Americans the freedom to make their own investment decisions, it's important that these platforms allow their users to participate on an equal playing field with the large banks, funds, and institutional investors that have dominated the stock market for decades.

You may be interested to know that I am a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. Given that this subcommittee is responsible for funding the operations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), I have a unique opportunity to engage with this agency on recent market volatility. In the coming weeks, I look forward to the opportunity to question the SEC Chair on the handling of this situation and will keep your concerns in mind as I have those discussions. The SEC must help provide answers to the thousands of retail investors who may have been harmed by the surprise restrictions put in place on January 28th. ""

Edit: Whether this Rep will really take this and run with it remains to be seen, however like I've been told more than once in my life....""You don't get if you don't ask"".",04-02-2021 22:46,131,2399,negative,-0.34,positive
This isn’t a gamble. This is a war!,282,lcew3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcew3w/this_isnt_a_gamble_this_is_a_war/,42,1612471610,"Okay guys, I know you are scared.
I know that it’s hard to not be able to see the future. But always remember why you started. What was your motivation for holding that long?

Was it money? If yes, did you get what you wanted? If you didn’t get what you wanted, then hold till you get it.

Was it to change something in your own life? If yes, did something change? If you didn’t get what you wanted, then hold till you get it.

Was it to change the world and give yourself and other people the opportunity to live a better life? If yes, did you achieve your dreams? If you didn’t, then hold until you got what you deserve.


Here is my reason:
I am and I always was a person who wanted to change something. I can’t stand seeing people starve. I can’t stand seeing people die because they can’t pay their medicine. I can’t stand seeing people overwork themselves until they are depressed and can’t feel happy anymore. I want all of you to be happy. In my humble opinion the whole system is corrupt and designed to favor the ones on top and to keep the others busy down here. I started to learn about investment back in my teenage years, because I knew I wanted to get out of this hole and to take as many people as I could with me.

Now, thanks to DFV we have the chance to change something big. We have seen billionaires cry, we have seen them throw a tantrum, we have seen market manipulation, we have seen the media be with us and then turn against us. We have big names like Mark Cuban (who said he would also hold, if he had some stocks) on our side whom gives us advice and defends us live on TV. Even only that billionaires are crying, accusing us and that many brokers restrict us from buying should be enough evidence that we‘re onto something big! They’re defending „their“ wealth with everything they can. They play dirty and they have power, but we‘ve got strength in numbers. If you hold, then I‘ll hold, then he will hold, then she will hold. We are in this together and if we want to succeed, we get to succeed. The only question is, how bad do you want it?

What’s the reason you got invested?

This blog post from 2008 describes a ""short down ladder"" attack used by shorting hedge funds:[https://shareholdersunite.com/the-ioc-files-useful-background-material/short-sellers-and-naked-shorting/](https://shareholdersunite.com/the-ioc-files-useful-background-material/short-sellers-and-naked-shorting/)

This Seeking Alpha post from 2014 describing flooding the order books with counterfeit shares:[https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp\_js\_v=a6&amp\_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)

This public comment on the SEC site from 2008 about how counterfeit shares were used to manipulate the price of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf)

Thanks u/Professional_Fig7437 for mentioning that this practice was previously called ""painting the tape.""  This SEC article describes an incident where the price was driven up, not down.

>placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices  (painting the tape) 

[https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/2008/dig082808.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/2008/dig082808.htm)

I vaguely remember another SEC document being posted here last week on the topic, but can't find it anymore. If anyone has a link to that or other documents, please PM or post in comments.

All of these documents roughly describe the same process of selling counterfeit shares back and forth to lower stock prices. Now, again, I cannot say for certain that such attacks are really possible. But I can say that they were *not* invented by reddit.

Now, I do not think the 100/200 share orders we've seen are proof of this. Nor do I think we've seen these attacks every day. However, I'm fairly certain we saw this attack specifically on the day RH blocked buying. The massive decrease in buy pressure would have allowed hedgies to freely trade back and forth without risking their shares being bought. RH blocking buys and ladder attacks combined probably caused the crash we saw that day.

And finally, back to GME short positions. For those wondering if Melvin has indeed covered their short position already, this article summarizes the possibility that they have bought synthetic longs from a MM (Citadel) instead: [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/)

- Low volume doesn't matter. We've seen this before. Although high volume is usually an indicator that a squeeze is happening, in this case it's just Melvin fucking with us and playing psychological warfare.

I'm an investor(ETF) since I turn 18 and active trader(Stonks) 3 years ago(not daily trader).

I see most of you need to learn what I learn in my short period of active trader, **fucking discipline and  be patient.** 

Most of newbies(myself also) when you start you look to the stonks every fucking time, stop, trace a strategy, do DD and make some math. Because one of the most, and I think remarcable fails, is when you try to catch momentum, when momentum is nearly over or will be flat during a long time, that is why people buy high and sell low, they are not stupid. They are like you and me, but they think as momentum goes the stonks will be flat or go higher. **WRONG**

Most of the time when momentum stops stonks suffer from correction or be more flat than your wife tits for a long time. If you do a nice DD and conclude stonk is under value just invest and forget about been flat or stupid fluctuations, correct your strategy over time and **stick to your fucking plan**. 

At this point if you made a correct prediction you will have gains, if don't you will lose. But either ways you will **Learn.** You can't learn a shit throwing yourself into the ""NeXt BiG ThInG"" it's okay to jump on trends but learn why are you fucking doing and avoid been a paper hand, buy high sell low.

Then more people said hey this looks like a good stock and I can see how their recent publicly announced hiring decisions and moves could benefit me in the future, because you know I am a gamer and love their products. Plus with the strengthening of the recently suppressed economy, this company could really blow up.

So armed with this all this public info, more people decided to invest. 

Then some already known and convicted insider trader lost 53% of his investors money and had to be bailed out by the company that hired an SEC employee to speak publicly at their events.

Recently, there’s been a split within the moderation team. Unfortunately, it didn’t end amicably. There are a group of us that want to push the subreddit forward and allow it to grow organically, while another group was afraid of the change that was coming and wanted to put restrictions in place to curtail that growth.

The OG mods are still here. In fact, we’ve been here every day, for hours on end working hard to help this community stay afloat and accommodate the influx of new users. There is no hedge fund attack, no grand conspiracy, just some run of the mill subreddit drama.

So let’s talk about that in a bit more detail.

The OG mods want this place to be run by the community and to grow as the community sees fit. Other mods that we placed our trust in disagree with this approach. Certain mods want to grow a personal following in their own name and act for themselves rather than acting as just one of the many wallstreetbets mods who are here to serve the community. Certain mods want to make this place political.

We tried to discuss this difference in approach and work through the issues. Some of the other mods weren’t interested in talking and chose the nuclear option. They chose to spread misinformation on the sub and in the daily threads. They chose to create stickies on the front page and in every thread. 

We had to take action to prevent this attempt to fracture the community, which resulted in some mods losing their privileges.

We didn’t take this action lightly. We know we may have hurt some feelings by doing this. But we simply refuse to stand by and watch this place be burnt to the ground. 

We were planning on waiting to announce this once we had everything lined up, but yes we have been approached by producers regarding a potential movie and many of the other mods were a part of those conversations, including /u/zjz. What wasn’t shared though, was that we are planning to donate any proceeds from this (if any!) to charity. Claiming this as evidence that we are attempting to “monetize the sub” is extremely dishonest.

We are here to protect the sub from manipulation. And we will continue to do just that, even if that manipulation comes from within and from people we once trusted.",04-02-2021 21:46,51,2257,neutral,0,positive

The reality is 60-80% of options trades lose CFD trades are about 60% losing. Shares trades I have no fucking idea but probably more than 50% lose.

Why is this a problem? Because last / this week the guys internalizing the trades got fucking rodgered, their loss porn would have made post on here look like fucking lunch money in 1982.

Can someone check my maths on this?

According to [shortsight](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/) most firms use shorts/float, so if a company has 100 shares and someone short sells 50 shares, that would be 50%? 

But shortsight uses shortsight uses shorts / (float + longs created by shortsellers), so 50 shorts on a 100 float company would be 50/150=33%

So these past few days I've been freaking out because ""short interest"" has dropped from apparently around 120% to just under 60% but 

60% = shorts / (float + artificial longs) 
means there are 60 shorts for every 100 longs including those longs created by the shorts. Which means 60 artificial longs and 40 float. 

Which means short interest calculated by anyone else = 60/40= 150%

I think the last number I saw was 58, so 58/42=138% 

So the hedge funds haven't even closed their positions?

Are retail shorters actually helping us out? [Theory],18,lcd7sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcd7sg/are_retail_shorters_actually_helping_us_out_theory/,4,1612464790,"I have a bit of a theory that I believe that retail shorters are actually helping us out, hear me out.

Not a financial advisor, just an ape with a dream to visit the moon.

This is regarding AMC, but could also apply for GME's current situation.

AMC currently has a reported short interest of 80% with free float of 56m shares. That means that about 44.8m of the shares in the free float have short contracts against them.

The current price drop that we saw, as funds and TUTs are trying to cover their asses, will only attract other retail shorters and institutional shorters who would bet that the price would drop even further, betting against it dropping $8 for example (For AMC).

However, what they are doing in the process is they are occupying the another % of the free float into shares that have short contracts against them - further lowering the total amount of shares that can be bought back by funds and tuts as there are fewer shares available to trade.

I feel like, not only are funds trying to make paper hands to sell their shares which they hold, so there's more supply in the market that will allow to cover the demand without spiking the price like crazy, but also they are trying to lower the price to a point where retail shorters would exercise their short contracts and return a % of the shares back into the public float.

If we were to look at a hypothetical:

Let's say that there are currently 100 shares (float). 80% of them are held by institutions as short interest - they have borrowed them and sold them in the market. That means that tuts need to buy back at least 80% of the float of the market to return to their ""owner"".

Let's hypothetically say that we, retail investors and institutional investors, own 15% of the free float. But what happens with retail shorters who enter the market, borrow existing shares (presumably from the 15% that we occupy to sell and return to the market. Let's say that they are currently taking up another 10% of the shares. Occupying an even higher amount of shares in the free float with short contracts against them. So, they borrow the shares that were already a part of the supply from the institutional shorters who sold in the market and was consequently bought from a retail investor or institutional investor. If the retail shorters buy back the shares that they have shorted, to return, that's fine for institutional shorters as the float is in their advantage. But if the price does not drop to a point that is comfortable for retail shorters, that leaves them with even less of wiggle room where they will have to buy at an even higher price than the market price.

So in the case of our example of 100 shares, that means that now they have 90% of shares in the float that have short contracts against them with 15% ownership. Meaning that 5% of the shares need to be bought back from second demand instead of primary demand - thus driving the price at which they can buy them back further up, thus further increasing the price of the stock, thus causing the institutional shorters to pay an even higher price, which will further drive up the market price.

Does this make any sense? I kind of suck at explaining shit.

That or I'm just full of shit.

My point being **(TL:DR)** is that, institutional shorters need to drive the price down further not only to make us sell, but to also incentivise retail shorters into exercising their contracts and thus returning the supply back to meet demand, otherwise that would lead to an even higher price jump.

Regardless, I'm holding. I believe in the cause and if it exposes market makers and institutional ownership of our ""free market"" at the cost of me losing some money (that i'm comfortable losing), then it's a win in my book.

I like the stock. I have spoken.

P.S This is not financial advise. I am not trying to create expectation, but I just have a speculation. The more we talk about this as a collective, the more educated decisions people on this board can make. After all, we are acting as an open access hedge fund at this point lol.

"I figured out what is going on with GME, listen",161,lcd6h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcd6h0/i_figured_out_what_is_going_on_with_gme_listen/,54,1612464630,"Okay fellow retards, i am either going full retard or full Michael Burry right now.

While my girlfriend was out with her boyfriend and i was playing with my Lego, i figured out what is going on, i am gonna make it very simple, because my brain does not allow me to make complex thoughts, so here goes.

First, we know that Melvin cuckital and other Hedge bros shorted heavily GME, the SI was 200069% and the strike should be fairly low, which leads to a short squeeze, now at this point the losses they were looking at was at the Billions or more ( that's a lot of money, in case you dont understand). A lot of apes here think that they are trying to floor the stock so they can cover their asses and not pay out, but here is the catch, THEY DON'T.

If HFs have so much power to destroy a stock while the price and volume is so fucking high combined with the fact that they can do this while the world is looking at them, then they would be Gazillionaires by now. If a HFs can create so much swing in a stock like GME, then what prohibits them from doing so in a smaller stock with much lower volume and make a shit ton of money all the time, the SEC ??? Fucking lmao if you thought that

My point here is, that we are overestimating their powers and i am going to explain why.

We got the news that shorts covered their positions, which everyone thought was BS, but i believe they actually did, and here is how.

We know that Melvin got around 50 Bn capital a few days ago, so how did they persuade investors to give them money??? Did they tell them they will try to manipulate the stock and bet that people will sell off, do you think rich people heard that and said ""Oh yeah, great idea, lets bet 50bn that retarded apes will panic and sell off"", fuck no, they proposed a real plan, that would not bet on us doing sane things and i am gonna tell you their plan and why it makes sense.

They know that GME is a ticking bomb, they know that people want GME to MOON, so they hedged their bets by manipulating the stock to drop at 80-90, possibly lower and buy a fuck ton of calls to hedge their retarded bet.
They feed the MSM with BS, manipulate the market, so the price drops, then they buy a fuck ton of calls/shares so they will limit their losses or even make more money. S3 partners, media, RH have started acting like our friends now, isnt this a bit suspicious??? It is, because they now want the stock to fucking rocket, so their friends can get their money back.

So what happened is, Melvin got money to buy calls, fed media BS to drop the price and buy calls at good prices, now the media,S3 and RH are with us, the stock will rocket and they will hedge their bets and cover their asses, it all makes sense.

Edit: I am kinda retarded and dont know how to use symbols so more people can understand, sorry

Lets Look at GME from a NON-BIAS standpoint,647,lcd15v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcd15v/lets_look_at_gme_from_a_nonbias_standpoint/,106,1612463988,"**THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVICE I AM NOT A PROFFESIONAL SO PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL.**

***I will simplify this very easily so new retards can understand this simply.***

1. Short Interest: ***This is ultimately why we got in***. **I don't care if you like the stock or not. We all want money at the end of the day, and that's the truth.** We really want those who shorted the shares to finally buyback the shares. The interest rate did drop from 140 to 120. This was a guarantee on the robinhood fiasco day. **That was only 20%**. And we got the confirmation from multiple sources. I am using highshortinterest.com which I do understand is not updated as frequently but it did update on that day. It comes as a huge surprise to me that 120 dropped to 51%. Either they bought it from other hedge funds at a background deal, or the day Robinhood manipulated the prices down, that rise up was the shorts selling. Thus we got back to 300ish from the low of 110. In this case, it has squeezed. **In the case it hasn't, the shorts are actually screwed if we just hold (we need a short interest update with actual legitimate facts, I do not know where to get this information besides the website stated. Do not listen to S3 partners, as they have gone back and forth with bs. Its an estimate)**

&#x200B;

2) **GME & AMC are following the exact same pattern**. This is a huge sign of manipulation. Although that shouldnt come as a surprise. When Robinhood let traders sell, shorts were able to cover for cheap as fuck. **THEY COMPLETELY SCREWED THE MOMENTUM, HOWEVER THIS CAN EASILY CHANGE, AS THERE ARE MORE BUYERS THEN SELLERS.**

3) **Silver diversion**: Let me just say this. GME AND AMC are basically the same situation but different Short interest. **If they wanted to divert from GME, they should of said we moved to AMC. But no they specifically mentioned silver. That is a huge sign, and this cannot be understated more that they want to close the movement.** You really need to think about how the news is reflecting this, and how it still continues to reflect it.

4)  GME is still testing grounds: GME is actually hovering 80-100. Like actually??? How is this even possible. We are still in the squeeze.  **If it crashed we would actually be at 40 right now.**

5) Short Ladder attacks: I was super hesitant to believe this shit. There's no actual sources, but we do have crammer in a video saying what hedge funds do in desperate circumstances.  The legimatacy of short ladder attacks is comparable to the following: This is basically like saying the assassination of Kennedy was not an actual hit, and when cocaine was brought into America, we just didn't have the resources to stop it from coming.

**I AM GOING TO BE HONEST, people definitely paper handed at this short ladder attack**. **This would actually bring their short interest down a bit, while keeping the stock price at a safe level.**

&#x200B;

6) **People are on our side. Listen carefully. We can actually win. I was retarded and thought this was going to be easy.** Of course it wasn't gonna be. Did you know why the Volkswagen short squeeze happened? Because one smart dude decided to hold and not sell, forcing high interest rates and shorts getting margin called. This is inevitable if we drive the price back up, they will be forced to buyback the shares.  **WE ALSO HAVE THAT ONE DIAMOND BALLS FCKER> DFV.**

&#x200B;

TLDR: HOLD 🚀🚀🚀

The long wait time suggests it is more than a little; otherwise why the long wait time?

I saw a post like this the other day but I feel like the point needs to be shared again.

We have done some crazy things in the past week and things are on the turn again but if your struggling with the losses and like me you find yourself watching the stock from open to close... Take a break, put your phone down if you get worried ""oh I'll miss the rocket"", put a stop limit in or a reminder on the stock price.

I'm seeing a lot of posts of people saying they've put house money in or there life savings... Firstly good work but just be careful none of us are financial advisors and YOU did that. so in my opinion just ride it, lower your average on the dips but don't put in more than what you have. your all adults.

First off, I’m new here. I caught the hype train and got in too late. Figured it could go either way but was worth a shot. Who knows what could still happen, but you know what? I WILL NOT SELL THESE SHARES! If this stock goes down to 10 cents/share I WILL STILL HOLD. Idgaf. Here’s why:

It has NEVER been more obvious to me that the playing field is not even. We are so outgunned and outmatched it’s ridiculous. IM SICK OF IT. I watched all these paper handed tards come in here, buy stock, then cower and  fall for the HF/Uber Wealthy’s scare tactics. 

I have known for a long time (as Im sure most/all of you do) that the people with insane amounts of money run the entire fucking world. Everyone knows that. This week was the first time I’ve witnessed the impact of their lying, corrupt, human garbage ways in real time. I watched them deny potential retail investors, Manipulate the market RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD, spread false narratives in the media, distract us with silver, DIVIDE AND CONQUER, and use scare tactics to get people to sell. AND all you dumbass paper handed fucks fell for it and played right into their hand. 

This is about more than money. Of course, I’d LOVE to make some on this stock, but I truly don’t give a shit if I do or not. I WILL NOT GET ON MY KNEES AND GET IN LINE FOR THEM. This is a principled stand against the puppet masters. Wake the fuck up and realize that these people are the real enemy. They will steamroll anyone and anything in their path. They will destroy anything they can if it means they get deeper pockets. They will do anything to keep us common apes from coming to their doors.. no matter how many lives get destroyed. 

To be clear, I don’t blame anyone for cutting their losses at this point. People invested way more than they could afford, which was your first mistake. If selling your shares is what’s best for you and your family, make that choice and go forward with a clear conscience. I just truly hope that people have learned something here. Not only about how to invest.. but about the system. I sure as hell have. 

End rant. There’s more I want to say but this should suffice.

≥100% SI is NOT conclusive proof of naked shorting,0,lcc6zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcc6zw/100_si_is_not_conclusive_proof_of_naked_shorting/,36,1612460207,"Here's why.

I'm fucking broke because I bought GME at $350 and 🧻👐 on Tuesday. This means that when I run out of instant lemonade to snort and need more, I go get a grand from a payday lender. There is now $1,000 of debt (owned by the payday lender) and $1,000 of cash (owned by me). 

The day after I take out my loan, my cousin Dan comes whining to me because his deathtrap beater broke down. (He shorted GME at $5 during the summer, so he's even more broke than I am.) Since I'm a sap, I loan him enough to get it fixed, say $500. Remember, I'm broke too, so that $500 comes out of the $1,000 I got from the payday lender.

Here's the important part: There is still only $1,000 of cash ($500 owned by Dan, $500 by me), but the amount of debt has gone up to **$1,500** ($500 owned by me, and the original $1,000 owned by the payday lender). **This is not illegal**, or even against the rules (to a greater extent than that the payday lender will be squeezing my balls, so I have a strong incentive to get up Dan's ass about his share—but at the end of the day that's a problem for the three of us and the local law enforcement couldn't give a shit).

*Shares that are sold short are just shares to the people who buy them, so they can usually be borrowed and sold short again*. This makes it possible for a stock to have, in theory, infinity% SI without a single naked short existing. 

Do naked shorts of GME probably exist anyway? If the fail-to-deliver statistics that have been posted here are remotely accurate, I would lean strongly towards yes. Is it still retarded to short a stock ≥100% of float (and will that probably produce a short squeeze)? Also yes. Does shorting still dilute the market and expose the shorter to significant risk even if it's not naked? Yes. But none of those mean you should go around stating GME's SI (real, theoretical, or historical) as any kind of proof that it's been shorted naked.

NIO is planning on building a ""world class electric vehicle campus"" in the city of Hefei--further strengthening a collaboration that NIO has with the municipal government of Hefei; this is BIG!

As stated by cnEVpost [here](https://cnevpost.com/2021/02/04/nio-to-build-world-class-smart-ev-industrial-park-in-hefei/), NIO will jointly build ""The Hefei Xinqiao Smart Electric Vehicle Industrial Park, the name of the campus, will integrate R&D, manufacturing, pilot demonstration and applications, and industrial support services, and will be built with leading international industrial innovation capacities and scale, NIO said"".

Furthermore, Gasgoo revealed something very interesting in their article on this big news too--here's the [link](http://autonews.gasgoo.com/70017970.html), and what they say is this: ""The signing of the framework agreement marks another significant milestone of the profound strategic partnership between NIO and Hefei. **The Hefei government and its associated parties plan to re-invest their returns from the equity investments in NIO China to support the further NIO**""

Anyone sleeping on NIO is insane at this point; NIO will be enormous in the future; and all the partnerships and collaborations that work in NIO's favor attest to this fact--in fact, you may not need to wait very long to NIO go considerably higher; they could easily be above $100-150+ this year alone!

Just relax, no need to panic, I'm sure things will get better. Do something different today for your wellbeing. Set a price alert and put your phone down.

Don't forget, only spend what you can afford to lose in the worst case scenario. I bought some stocks because I can afford to lose it all and it won't make a difference to my financial circumstances. 

We all knew HF were crooks and never played fairly; the GME move just proved this fact and illustrated that these scums will do anything in their power, including but not limited to, openly breaking the laws and regulation, in order to win. Needless to say, they must be so frustrated right now because none of their tactics have really worked: market manipulation (stopping the public from buying freely by bribing shit brokers like RH), ladder attack (selling to their own partners to bring the price down), use of media to spread fake news, bribing government officials and so on. I feel like the more they try the more they fail. 

I'm sure our FCA is a lot better than your SEC when it comes to bringing the scums down. It seems your SEC is ran by some cowboys / sponsored lawyers. What I don't understand is what in the world is FBI doing when HF are openly committing crime in daylight?!

I've been really depressed for months and always have suicidal thoughts throughout my life and last week I was feeling very low and heard of all this GME and the positivity of it all and down with it, I was in need of a little happiness and good fortune while helping others at the same time. 

I don't have a lot but I put in everything I had $100 @ 338 and then $400 @ 330 to hold for a longtime and then bought more, the money I needed to live on to try cover my loss as I thought it would go up within a few days. I own 3.28 shares. With a -$650 loss starting with $900

But Its now looking like I will have to sell everything at about $90 as I'm completely out of money and in debt. 

I feel sick, cheated and now even more broke and broken. 

It's not right the criminal activity and manipulation of the hedge funds lowering the value of the shares! 

The incorrect information and lies from mainstream media and manipulation to drive people not to buy resulting in the share value going down. 

Restricting free trade by many trading apps not allowing people to buy and only sell. 
Hugely impacting the value by causing panic and mass selling resulting in the value of shares going down. 

Where is the justice and hope for the small people if we are restricted from fair trade. 

Hope it rockets after I'm out you all make life changing gains if I wasn't in debt and broke I would hold 


Edit: I know it was completely my mistake putting the money i needed in. And the blame is completely my own and I will suffer because of that. I've never gambled before but then we could say everything we do in life is a gamble. But I thought of it as a investment to hold and something to actually own. 

900 is a lot for me as I currently don't work due to my mental health. I'm a ex soldier and 33. 
I did do my research and wouldn't say I'm dumb just a very bad, stupid decision after the money i was going to hold with. Maybe my mental health played apart of that or I was just not thinking in the moment. 

Thanks for the positive comments and messages from others that have suffered also. 
And thanks for constructive criticism it helps also.

Right now for the reason of the movement, but here is another major reason why I know it, and other theaters will blow.

Think about it, the future of workmanship, UBI, AI taking over jobs, it will pressure society to rethink what it means to live and enjoy life in the next 10 years.

What does one do if they have free money, no work, and the desire to do SOMETHING?

They do one (or more) of 3 major things:

- They learn / explore
- They socialize / connect
- They have fun / seek entertainment

AMC is step 3 of this societal change, but most importantly, step 2 as well. It resolves the human desire to both socialize and be entertained.

That is why I am convinced things like digital/physical entertainment will blow up like mad. It seems trivial, but old school physical theatres are going to be huge as we go back to our roots. There is also a massive opportunity in VR as well.

What are your thoughts on entertainment stocks outside of this movement?

Edit: To add, I think this interest for physical entertainment will never die down as humanity advances because once we peak in terms of mobile / VR technology, we will be far more intrigued to go back to our roots. Its for this reason that physical sports will never die. The reason athletes arent just hopping on digital hockey, soccer, football etc.",04-02-2021 18:37,27,1471,neutral,0,positive

If I was sitting on shorty mc shorts this would scare the hell out or me. 

The next step would then be to slowly and steadily release news about the new strategy. One little piece at a time, a few days apart, for a very very long time. Together with a charming communication strategy which rally employees, fans of the company, and us who Like the Stock. You are recommended and more than welcome to belong to all three of these categories if you ask me. 

We like the Stock!

In the middle of this rallying movement also bring on the news about RC himself increasing his position towards 19.99%, in several small batches so those news can hit outlets and the street in a flow. 

Beneath all this there are us in GME Gang, old and new members with Diamond Hands and conviction. APES TOGEHER!

Also keep up the relentless vigilante billboard campaign, in the long run this kind of movement is supporting the chances of an epic turnaround to succeed. Imagine going to work at your local GameStop store in the morning and you see one of these beauties, I would be inspired to stick around and do my best. 

This entire event around the Short Squeeze, the politics, the story, has put the brand on the radar of the entire world in a way rarely seen, it is value in itself to be added to the fundamentals of the company.

And if you've been a real wsb 🦍 who's been following what's going on (no, not that garbage on cnn, wsj, etc.) you'll see that what RH, the HF, etc did/still-doing is a transparently illegal bear raid. And this doesn't just involve SEC acts but also other fields of law, like freakin' RICO. I shit you not here is case law: Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited v. S.A.C. Capital Management, LLC (2017)

The defendants here did the exact same thing we KNOW Melvin, RH, and all those other guys did (I would actually argue the case is much more severe in our current situation) and the other guys almost got hit with a RICO but barely got out on jurisdictional technicality.

Spent the last 3 days on the phone but nobody's answering over there so today pulled the trigger and started the transfer to Schwab.

No one individual gets to set the price of a stock, a stock price is completely based on supply and demand. No one individual gets to say I can't buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares. 

Think about it. There is a BIGGER question here. Something very fishy is going on.

Please share this as wide as possible. Brokerages have no right to tell us in a free market how much we can and cannot pay for a stock.

I feel like I need to say something so people don't $ROPE thinking they have no other choice but to pray for a squeeze.

I need people to understand that not selling (depending on the stock) is also losing because of OPPURTUNITY COST. I am not telling you to sell if this was fun money for you, but I see people taking out fucking loans to play a momentum run that prior to this only ranged between $3-$25 per share for the last 4 years. 

Yes I understand Cohen can make changes to make GME a successful businesses, but understand it can take years. If you bought at 300-500 you will basically NEED a short squeeze to get out of those positions.  If your paper loss is already -75%, than ya, probably just hold, but do what is best for YOU.

The heavy realized loss that I took from my last GME trade hurt a lot, but I took my remaining capital and made a good chunk of my loss back up already (BA and MSFT). Sometimes you need to be proactive and not wait/pray for a short squeeze to happen. 

For example: If I have a position in AAPL and for whatever reason it drops 30%, I wont sell it since I know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of AAPL's FUNDAMENTALS. 

People need to understand that GME was a high risk high reward play. If you believe that this stock was manipulated, then what makes you think they will stop now? If you are confident in your position then hold.

I pray that a short squeeze does happen since I sympathize with people that lost their fucking life savings on this play, but at the end of the day you need to do what is best for YOU.",04-02-2021 17:38,84,1741,positive,0.1232,positive

So, if the valuation is $30, why is it still at $100 even after all the buying restrictions? Why wasn’t it just a pump to 400, instead of that being the low number the squeeze went to compared to what was predicted on over 100% shorts. 

Why was $400 the peak of the “squeeze” and not the price because of the *viral* interest it had and a basement level ease of entry at $1 for a fractional share... before they restricted us from buying to really start the gamma squeeze?

Why are people saying that it can’t go up when we haven’t seen the data about the actual percentage of short positions we want to see that’s being released on the 9th? Why not hold until then at least so we know the whole story before selling?

Stocks go up and down, and if we’re still pushing the $100 mark after all that we went up against so far, who’s to say we can’t keep up the pressure and keep the price there? And even if it dips lower, people can take the income tax reduction or buy more at the lower price and average out eventually, and there’s good prospects for its future with its new leadership team I think. It’ll eventually go up in price, most of these people are millennials and will be alive when the price of every stock is 10x higher in general anyway in 2050 or whatever if they just hold... Heck, I’ve rode other stocks and stuff through worse swings than this, I’m young and believe that everything’s gonna inflate in value after this whole “millennial trading hype” becomes the norm amongst people with smartphones and access to fractional shares.

Also, what’s to stop them from allowing this new influx of excited people who are catching on running it up to 500 or whatever and them going, “look, the squeeze happened!”, when it’s just a pump in price? And then people miss out on the real squeeze? I say just hold regardless.

That’s just what I believe. But I’m not a financial advisor and don’t suggest anyone trade based off my comments. I just believe in GameStop 🤷🏻‍♂️

Can we agree that Fidelity’s App is hot garbage,145,lca9xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lca9xz/can_we_agree_that_fidelitys_app_is_hot_garbage/,68,1612452045,"Hello fellow autists 🦍. I come before you today to enlist your help in submitting a formal request to Fidelity to fix that God awful thing they call an app. 

After last week’s obvious attempt to thwart retail investors I decided to take my talents to Fidelity, and by talents I mean net loss portfolio. By the way, dont be me. While transferring your portfolio your stocks are frozen so you lose the ability to sell your stocks. So if GME and AMC had skyrocketed to 1,000,000,000 and then quickly shot back down to $0.01 during the transfer, I literally wouldve had to say GG. The squeeze would have been squoze ladies and ladies. Dont. Do. What. I. Did. Just wait for this all to be over then bounce they way GME will bounce then head for the moon.

Anyway, now that i’m on Fidelity, im happy to be on a platform that actually looks out for the little guy and doesnt mind the poor steal from the rich but jesus christ is this user interface GARBAGE. To check your positions and watchlist you have to engage with a Microsoft Excel-like sliding page which is a pain. You also have to change your account setting (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8zg30/fidelity_users_beware/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)post) when you create it in order to get live charts as opposed to the default 15-minute late charts that you open your account . And even if they were live charts, on the app the charts themselves are nothing compared to that of Robinhood’s charts. (Honestly none of that matters because I cant read anyway)

But seriously until the app gets a makeover i’ll probably end up using Robinhood just to look at charts and Fidelity to enter. I know it’s a pain in the ass but i’m hardheaded and wanna feeling like im sticking it to “the man”.

So again, I ask that as a unit we make something shake and actually get Fidelity to make their app more user friendly for us retarded folk.

1. If they purchased the shorts as part of Melvin, can the company just declare bankruptcy and default on their payments/requirement to pay back their shares?
2. Is anybody else concerned that they're just buying time to store all their money offshore in some safe account right now and then will just default on their shorts (again I don't know if this is even possible).

Robinhood must issue a public request asking Citadel LLC to sell its stake in the trading app to other existing investors.

Curious to get your take. Do you agree with me?

The only justification for keep Citadel LLC on the cap table is that it ensures Robinhood always has access to a market maker in Citadel Securities, but there are others on the market. I'm just not sure if people they are the same shitty, less shitty, or more shitty.

Simple explanation of why I’m still holding 530 shares of GME,812,lc9vdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc9vdw/simple_explanation_of_why_im_still_holding_530/,86,1612450378,"I just join WSB last week and I’m happy to be with you retards on this journey. As a fellow retard I’m not well versed the mechanical jargon of wall street. I know enough to understand what is going on, but I’ve always stayed away from shorting, margin, or options. So honestly, my smooth ape brain hurts reading about short ladder attacks, ITM/OTM contracts, and naked shorts. I’m sure the 6 million new subscribers feel the same way. So I’m going to break down in super simple terms why I’m still holding the stock.

First though, it’s important to face reality. This movement to take on the hedge funds has died down. WSB was getting over 1 million new subscribers per day and now it’s only gaining maybe 100,000 subscribers. The google trend data for GME stock shows significantly less traffic. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d3wb3rberef61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=95dcdb0f6da867d48f75d4c550ecf3022e2d9d9e

Also, a ton of paper handed fucks sold their positions and gave billions back to the hedge funds. 

Since there are less people joining and at lot of people who have sold out of GME, there is a significantly less of a forced short squeeze. BUT IM STILL NOT SELLING. WHY? I’ll break it down with super simple math that even an ape can do.

According to Yahoo Finance there are 47 million shares in the public float. Meaning shares available for the public to trade. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnzbtfifref61.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=22ebb708330316cf3f3c2f0ece4ae1049c9a8506

&#x200B;

There are 8.5 million subscribers on WSB. If each subscriber held an average of 5.5 shares, WSB would control the entire float! If the entire float was owned by WSB, then WSB would literally control the price of the stock. 

Yes, I know that not all 8.5 million subscribers are going to buy GME. And even if WSB did, a lot of retards have paper hands and would sell early. Also, many subscribers are just here to enjoy the show or are bots. 

But let’s pretend that just 25% have diamond hands and buy GME. That would mean there would be 2.125 million people buying the stock. If 25% each bought an average of 22 shares, WSB would control the entire float. 

2.125 million x 22 = 46.75 million

This is definitely possible, although not probable given the recent developments. However, the risk vs reward is still very lucrative.  I created a probability table and assigned a probability of GME hitting certain prices. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l2yc12qhref61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=36dc52815b342660fef85a02e08597c2d924ad65

According to my table, I estimate that the probability that GME will go to $75 or less at 73%. However, in the event that WSB controls the shares of GME, the price would skyrocket. It doesn’t matter if the short interest is at 100%, 50%, or 25%, there will be shorts that need to cover and there will be no supply. 

I believe I’m being very conservative with my estimates on the upside. I assign a 27% chance that the price of the stock would go to $150 or more. Out of the 27%, I only give a 1% chance that the price will go to 2000. 

If you take all of the prices and assign a probability to each price, you get a weighted average price of $182

Given the current price of $89 that would represent a 104% return. 

To be clear, I am in no way telling WSB to buy GME in order to gain control of the price. I’m just saying, if WSB happens to control it, the upside will be significant if one were to get in at this price, but what do I know. I’m just a monkey, ape, retard, idiot, autist, blah blah blah.

I’m going to try and keep this as straightforward as possible as I’ve been seeing tons of posts with complicated shit that I can’t read and that. I also think we are complicating this situation more than we need to.

**I don’t need to understand every detail about the situation to understand when my enemy is weak and beat down.** The media has been trying to push the narrative that the shorts have been covered and we have lost; however, I can hardly see how this could be possible. Again, I’m not sure how this all works in terms of details but what I do know is that **this is an unprecedented event.** Everyone over the course of the past weeks has been claiming that this was going to be the biggest squeeze ever and would alter the financial landscape. Despite this I have yet to see it come true.

**GME was shorted something like \~140% a few weeks ago, but I simply cannot believe that the hedgie scumbags would’ve taken a substantial loss and covered their shorts at any point last week, it was simply too expensive and the volume wasn’t there**. Although one of you is probably typing some complicated ass essay about how they could’ve covered their shorts I’m going to ask a simple question. **Why would these hedgie scums be investing time and money to short ladder attack GME today, especially since they’re claiming they’ve covered? THIS DOESN’T MAKE SENSE AT ALL.**

Now I could be wrong, but to me, **this seems like the bully on the playground**. We as retards cannot read the minds of the hedge funds nor do we understand their sorcery. What we do know is **💎 MF 🙌. What I’m trying to say is that the playground bully aka the hedge funds are assholes and trying to push us around and convince us that we’ve lost through ladder attacks, spreading claims of covering, and manipulating the markets. BUT what we must remember bullies act for a reason** whether it’s a shitty home situation, your wife not getting piped down by her boyfriend or **not covering your shorts.** I’m convinced they havent covered their shorts and today the only people selling are 📝 **🙌 betas.**

Retards we have not lost. Our enemy is trying to scare us. We’ve been saying it for days. They’ve been doing all the dirty tricks, and I know we always say we will HOLD, but seriously if **WE HOLD THEY HAVE TO COVER AT SOME POINT.**

LOOK PAST THE BULLY ON THE PLAYGROUND POINT OUT HIS FLAWS. **THEY ARE FUCKING WITH US AND THIS IS THE FIRST TEST OF MANY. THEY HAVEN’T COVERED SHIT.** Look at the damage we have caused so far, look how they're counting us out. **Show them how retarded we can be and HOLD THIS SHIT.**

Look at the retard commenting above you and below you. They’re holding and you better be too. Don’t let them down. We like this stock, the stock is great. TOGETHER WE CAN WIN. But only together. Cuban was right, we need to show them strength in numbers. **Why would a billionaire side with a bunch of retards if he didn’t know we had something going, something special?**

Now look, many of you sold today, and I get it. It’s hard when you have to look at the red and see your money drop. But what about the spaceship. The spaceship never broke down, it was broken and flawed since the beginning, but we found how to fix it. **Get back on the ride together and lets soar, beyond the moon.** **Robinhood upped the amount you can buy.** Now’s a great chance to get in on this great stock because it’s only going up and it’s cheap for what it will be worth in the future.

**HOLD. THE. FUCKING. LINE. BUY. THE. DIP**

I bought 4 shares @ $335 and for a broke college student like me its quite a bit. And I know it’s not much compared to DFV, and many others but if we all can see the strength in numbers each share is worth so much more.

&#x200B;

**TL:DR: They haven’t covered shit. We are not losing, and we can still win. But only if we work together and hold.**

My husband and my boyfriend are a finance dude, but many of the questions I’ve asked have stretched their knowledge on the matter. Especially on this stock which has more to do with psychological warfare than with the F-word (fundamentals). After today and the announcements from GameStop it got me wondering...  

First, I know that at some point, Game Stop repurchased a bunch of their own shares. They knew something before most did, and that was that they were putting some real money and effort behind amping up their image and offering. I heard they closed down locations, did a sale/lease deal with their warehouse locations, and even sold off the firm’s jet, just in order to buy more of their own stock.  

So they’re invested, just like we are, into the price of this stock. I believe that, because they’re invested like us, they’re likely to work on a strategy that would be beneficial to all of us as well. I know we can’t compare ourselves to the VW squeeze- we lack the element of surprise and an instant lack of stocks to purchase the same way they did. However... what are the mechanics of if some other company came in and announced that they were/had bought in to GME? Could they have done this already without our knowing? What would they have to do if they wanted to? Just seems like a decent play and I’m trying to learn more about how this shit works. What other possible plays could GameStop make which would be good for them but also good for us?  

Do other hedge funds have a benefit if they were to disclose their positions? If this is a war of ownership it just seems like it would be beneficial to all parties involved and bought-in to disclose positions, so that we look like a united front. Combine that with some other large buy from an interested party and that could be huge, right?  

After hearing about the possibility of a streaming service to compete with Twitch, I became interested in actually going long with GME. Even at $325. Not only that, but I feel like GameStop will go forward with the feeling of “we need to justify all the faith put into us.” I can’t imagine another company that would feel as much obliged to the approval of their share holders than GameStop. Can you imagine the necessity to deliver that board must feel?? They ought to.  

Just thoughts from a baby ape. It’s been fun getting involved with the sub I’m constantly hearing my boyfriend and husband talk about when they’re jerking each other off. Thanks for humoring an annoying noob. At the very least, I’ll always know that I’m not a fucking paper hands bitch. FTR, in the week since I’ve put $25k into GME, I’ve gotten another $6.5k in payments in real life. There are real life lessons to be learned from not being a paper hands bitch. I’m a better, ballsier businesswoman after this week. I love hanging out with you fucking retards and I’m looking forward to posting many future loss/gain porns which will be completely unrelated to GME. 💜💎🙌🏼

Nokia Q4 Earning Report just released.,403,lc9klt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc9klt/nokia_q4_earning_report_just_released/,108,1612449150,"The whole report can be seen [here](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/04/2169538/0/en/Nokia-Corporation-Financial-Report-for-Q4-and-Full-Year-2020.html).

Here are the key points mentioned in the report. I will follow up with important things that I personally took note of. Overall, Nokia absolutely kicked ass in 2020 considering the economic implications of COVID, and projections for 2021 and beyond look good.

**Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and Full Year 2020**

**Solid margin performance driven by customer demand in North America**

* 5% year-on-year decrease in reported net sales in Q4, primarily due to Mobile Access, as declines in network deployment and planning services were partially offset by growth in radio access products
* 1% growth in constant currency net sales in Q4
* Continued improvements in our Mobile Access portfolio; strengthening roadmaps, reducing product costs and improving product performance; commitment to invest in R&D to drive product leadership
* Increase in Mobile Access gross margin in Q4, primarily driven by improved 5G gross margin, partially offset by a project-related loss provision
* Positive operating profit, on a reported basis, in Q4 and full year 2020
* Non-IFRS operating profit in Q4 benefited by approximately EUR 250 million, due to the timing of revenue recognition and a net positive fluctuation in Nokia’s venture fund investments
* Strong free cash flow in Q4 and full year 2020 benefited from an early customer payment of approximately EUR 0.5 billion, which was expected in Q1 2021
* Derecognized EUR 2.9 billion of Finnish deferred tax assets, which are not lost
* Reiterated outlook for 2021 comparable operating margin of 7-10% and provided new outlook for net sales and free cash flow
* Board does not propose a dividend or dividend authorization for the financial year 2020

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My personal notes -

* Nokia kicked ass in 2020. Keep in mind that the Corona economy heavily impacted many companies this year, and infrastructure/5G development for Nokia was generally slowed down YoY; yet Nokia still met Operating Margin targets as well as growing the reach of the business overall.
* Nokia met their Operating Margin target of 7%-10% at a solid 7.2%.
* Nokia has successfully maintained and is now operating a completely independent international supply chain with 25 locations.
* Nokia has projected a Net Sales growth in 2021 as demand for 5G infrastructure will continue to grow.
* Though net sales are down, the reduction in sales is being offset by increased demand for 5G products and infrastructure.
* There were €200MM revenue that has been delayed (not lost) as a result of COVID.
* Nokia expects to take advantage of €150MM in benefits from COVID in 2021.
* Nokia management is NOT issuing a dividend this year in order to stimulate better growth and retain higher Free Cash Flow. **They project net positive growth in 2021, and would like to instate a dividend for 2021.**
* YoY EPS increase.
* QoQ EPS decrease. Nokia has stated that this is likely a result of €2.9 Billion deferred taxes being unrecognized.
* 3rd Quarter in a row with increase in Free Cash Flow.
* 2020 ended with €2.5 Billion in Free Cash Flow.",04-02-2021 16:32,38,3319,neutral,0,positive
Questions regarding GME,83,lc9ivk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc9ivk/questions_regarding_gme/,58,1612448963,"Hey WSB,

I had a few questions regarding GME. Now, I'm no paper-handed bitch, but did want to open a discussion up as to a few things that have been on my mind.

1. Assuming short ladder attacks exist, what's stopping the hedge funds from just continuing to do it til we reach 0?

2. What's the point of the hedge funds doubling down on their shorts if they don't think it'll go down more? Wouldn't this actually be a BAD sign for us retail investors (gamblers, retards, apes, whatever you wanna call it)

3. How come the short squeeze (assuming it still happens) would increment the price like it did with VW? Why can't the shorts just cover their positions slowly over time?

4. How long do we realistically have to hold GME in order for a short squeeze to actually happen? I know everyone here's always saying ""oh they're paying a shit ton of interest per day, they HAVE to cover soon"". Isn't that interest rate smaller than actually paying for shares upwards of $42069 (obviously a meme number, more realistically, I'm assuming if the squeeze is to be squoze, we'd reach $1000, maybe upwards of $2000. I can't see it being much more without some HF tricks being pulled in order to prevent it from going up that high).

Mind you, I'd love to be bullish, and worst case scenario this is a year long+ hold for me, I believe Ryan Cohen definitely will be able to actually bring GameStop to a much larger market cap, and this is a much more, imo, lucrative sector than pet food/toys/whatever else. I'm sure he'll be able to expand into the tech sector as well, with Matt Francis being the new Chief Technology Officer, definitely looks like he'll be able to bring together a decent team of engineers (if you're reading this, I'm looking for a Software Engineering Internship for this summer or if any of you redditors have connections lmk...)

I am idiot and 5 beers deep but I have seen several posts from people saying that S3 had recently changed their short % float formula to hide things. 

They are referencing traditional SI % float figures and the new “S3 SI% float” figures, saying this S3 SI figure is a new or recently changed formula. But I’m looking at tweets from S3 as far back as October here where they have been mentioning the S3 SI% float this whole time based on what I’m seeing.

S3 partners short interest miscalculation argument,70,lc965q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc965q/s3_partners_short_interest_miscalculation_argument/,27,1612447565,"Check out u/nov81 and his post on the S3 short interest numbers before reading. Typing on mobile so excuse shitty formatting.

Essentially, the argument is that there is an old and new short interest calculation used by S3 partners which is true. I decided to look a little deeper into this an actually verify what he was saying. 

These are the two equations as per S3 partners founders Twitter:

Old - SI = shares_short / float

New - SI = shares_short / (float + shares_short)

The new equation, by adding the numerator to the base, creates a asymptote in which means it is impossible to touch 100% short interest and as a result is impossible to go above. No real issue here. 

u/nov81 claims however, that the reason for the sudden drop in share short is that whatever analyst at S3 decided to take the short interest calculated from the new equation, then use that to find # shares short from the old equation. 

This makes sense because because algebra would tell you that you cannot solve for two unknowns in an equation as simple as this, no cube roots or quadratics or whatever. This means that when we try and calculate shares short using the new equation, we get this; 

shares_short = SI * (float + shares_short) 

We cannot rearrange for shares_short using valid algebra. You could spend hours trying to, but it’s not possible. This here shows that in trying to calculate shares_short we need the shares_short variable, which is already unknown. You get the idea. His idea is that with this, an analyst then went onto use the old equation to recalculate the shares short. 

shares_short = SI * float

The issue with this, is if we substitute SI for the new equation, we get this:

shares_short = (shares_short/(float + shares short)) * float 

You see the issue? There is no way to calculate shares_short without knowing short interest, and the short interest cannot be calculated without knowing shares_short. Neither calculation is feasible, the logic is flawed. 

The day in which these shorts were covered was the day we saw the second peak in price. Most of this peak was in post market in which institutional investors have full right to buy and sell shares, and institutional investors are the one covering the shares. 

Not only this, but u/nov81 needs to explain why Ortex also showed a drop of the same size shares short? I could have easily fucked up this math and an open to anyone correcting me, but even so there is no explanation for ortex. 

Regardless, there are STILL 26M shares sold short. When we covered 26M shares there was a large price move which we may see the likes of again as we stay sitting at this $90 support. 

TL:DR; misinformation but shouldn’t matter because 50% short interest still high as fuck",04-02-2021 16:06,50,2745,positive,0.128,positive
THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE WSB? THE SEC ARE HYPOCRITES AND LIERS THAT ARE PROTECTING THE RICH AND POWERFUL,2303,lc941y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc941y/they_want_to_investigate_wsb_the_sec_are/,111,1612447353,"From the very beginning, we knew these people weren't our friends. The SEC **VOWED** to protect retail traders, for ONCE. The media has swept this narrative under the rug, and are now happily pushing the new trend, calling for more regulation.

They have lied through their teeth.

CNBC hosts a show with Jim Cramer called MAD MONEY, where stocks are literally called left and right with little or ZERO fundamental analysis. The show itself does not provide any significant evidence to support these stock calls, but instead refers investors to THESTREET - a firm that does publish simple balance sheets of companies, then gives their 2 cents on such.  

  
They decided to investigate us rather than the CNBC pumpers/fear mongers that pushed FALSE NARRATIVES FOR CITADEL, the hedgies which shorted more shares than existed with money that doesn't exist (crippled a company for years), and brokers that openly restricted trade of certain securities for little reason (this is real market manipulation).

We will water the fountain of liberty with the tears of bears and boomers. This is not over. They will soon be running SCARED SHITLESS. Notice how Gamestop the company didn't issue more shares and dilute. They didn't dilute at $500, $300, and here we are at $90 and still nothing. With 88%+ short interest, they must really know that this valuation is low. Not a single insider share has been sold either, to my knowledge. I will personally hold until GameStop dilutes and can fix their balance sheet, I literally want to see this company healthy again. 

For the last time, THE MEDIA IS NOT OUR FRIENDS. They said we were a mob and called for more regulation at first before they realized it was popular to support us. They said we were ""gamifying"" trading. They said we were all radical right, and white supremecis. Worst of all they pushed a false narrative that we were pumping SLV, in a likely attempt to gain hype for a citadel long position, so they could liquidate and have more funds for GME covering.",04-02-2021 16:02,104,2380,positive,0.7717,positive

GME simple explanation,140,lc9396,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc9396/gme_simple_explanation/,29,1612447272,"This is very simple, for all the hype it’s easy to explain exactly what happened and what’s happening. Nikola, a company who has never produced a product and is widely believed to be outright fraud has a marker cap of ~$8.3B as of Feb 3rd, 2021. GameStop, a company with ~40k employees in the growing industry of video games has a market cap of ~$6B. A few months ago a dynamic businessman, Ryan Cohen bought millions of shares of GameStop, and then joined the board with other former Chewy executives (an online pet supply store worth ~$40B). People who had long believed GameStop has more value than the market was giving it (a low of ~$250M total market value at one point), along with new people who now saw potential in this businesses turn around, bought stock in the business. That should be the end of the story.

It’s because hedge funds on Wall Street have again been so greedy that they risked the entire United States financial system. See, these hedge funds “shorted” the stock, 140%. How can you have 140% of an entire companies stock? You can’t but they did. And the risk, which they never considered in their infinite wisdom, is infinite losses. Infinite losses? Yes, a stock price can go to $0 and the shareholders lose all their money and the company is bankrupt. But a stock has no top dollar amount, and when you’re short a stock, you bet it goes to 0, but if you’re wrong it can go as far up as any stock has ever gone for any reason. A good reason would be, the stock went up for fundamental reasons but the short positions couldn’t unwind because you can’t undo 140%, you could only undo 100%. Therefore, in using market manipulation to drive a company into bankruptcy they were suddenly faced with infinite losses, something that would send catastrophic ripples through the financial industry.

So, Robinhood. We all thought they were cool but like Facebook they’re fucking evil because they’re free, so instead of paying $6 a trade we pay $0, which was cool until last week when we found out that in spite of their name Robinhood, they are actually in the business of selling financial data to hedge funds. They take your trade order, and let the hedge funds know so their High Frequency Trading can arbitrage pennies on every trade by “beating” it to the order, millions of times a day. Ok, fuck us millennials, ok yeah but also, a little consumer protection, maybe? Ok - this is where it gets fucked.

What we learned Thursday is that Wall Street and the stock brokers do not have America’s interest their interest is to hedge funds and banks. Trading was restricted, whether it was Robinhood, the brokers, the Market Makers, we may never know but it’s not that important because it reveals that the system is fundamentally and structurally aligned to protect the few existing billionaires against Americans interest. This is a fatal sin against our democratic capitalism and risks everything we stand to be.

Moreover, they did it for a reason, the same people that control our stock markets, the barons of our nations wealth, also risked destroying them with infinite losses. How do you cover -140% to infinity? This would alter the value of every equity in America, so they shut it down.

Now, as we try to piece this together, one wrong is repairing the damage done to individual investors but the bigger change needs to be structural, prosecuting the criminals we allow to run our economy and rebuilding an equitable market to allow the American dream to prosper.
